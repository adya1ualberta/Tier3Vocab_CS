IN

OBVIOUSLY
THE

HOWEVER
IN

SOMETIMES

THIS

PROVE

IN

IT
IS
OFTEN

WITH
THE

THAT
WE

COUNTEREXAMPLE

THESE
FOUR

ARE

A
START

CONDITIONAL
STATEMENTS
FORMED
FROM

ONLY
THE
CONTRAPOSITIVE
ALWAYS
HAS
THE

WE

THE
CONTRAPOSITIVE

P
OF

P

THE

AS
P
Q
TO

ONLY
WHEN

THAT
IS

WE
NOW
SHOW

P

HAS
THE

AS
P

FOR

NOTE
THAT
WHEN

THE

BUT
THE
CONVERSE

ARE
BOTH
TRUE
WHEN
TWO
COMPOUND
PROPOSITIONS
ALWAYS
HAVE
THE

WE
CALL
THEM
EQUIV

SO
THAT
A
CONDITIONAL

CONTRAPOSITIVE
ARE
EQUIVALENT
THE
CONVERSE

THE

OF
A
CONDITIONAL

ARE
ALSO

NEITHER

WE
WILL
STUDY

TAKE
NOTE
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST

IS
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THE

REWRITTEN
AS

THE

WHY

WHO
HAS
PUBLISHED
MORE
THAN
A
DOZEN
BOOKS
CONTAINING
CHALLENGING

WE
WILL
ALSO

THE
EXTREMELY
POPULAR
LOGIC
PUZZLE
SUDOKU
EXAMPLE
IN
SMULLYAN
POSED
MANY
PUZZLES
ABOUT
AN
ISLAND
THAT
HAS
TWO
KINDS
OF
INHABITANTS
KNIGHTS
WHO
ALWAYS
TELL
THE
TRUTH
AND
THEIR
OPPOSITES
KNAVES
WHO
ALWAYS
LIE
YOU
ENCOUNTER
TWO
PEOPLE
A
AND
B
WHAT
ARE
A
AND
B
IF
A
SAYS
B
IS
A
KNIGHT
AND
B
SAYS
THE
TWO
OF
US
ARE
OPPOSITE
TYPES
SOLUTION
LET
P
AND
Q
BE
THE
STATEMENTS
THAT
A
IS
A
KNIGHT
AND
B
IS
A
KNIGHT
RESPECTIVELY
SO
THAT
P
AND
Q
ARE
THE
STATEMENTS
THAT
A
IS
A
KNAVE
AND
B
IS
A
KNAVE
RESPECTIVELY
WE
FIRST
CONSIDER
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
A
IS
A
KNIGHT
THIS
IS
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
P
IS
TRUE
IF
A
IS
A
KNIGHT
THEN
HE
IS
TELLING
THE
TRUTH
WHEN
HE
SAYS
THAT
B
IS
A
KNIGHT
SO
THAT
Q
IS
TRUE
AND
A
AND
B
ARE
THE
SAME
TYPE
HOWEVER
IF
B
IS
A
KNIGHT
THEN
B
STATEMENT
THAT
A
AND
B
ARE
OF
OPPOSITE
TYPES
THE
STATEMENT
P
Q
P
Q
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
TRUE
WHICH
IT
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
A
AND
B
ARE
BOTH
KNIGHTS
CONSEQUENTLY
WE
CAN
CONCLUDE
THAT
A
IS
NOT
A
KNIGHT
THAT
IS
THAT
P
IS
FALSE
IF
A
IS
A
KNAVE
THEN
BECAUSE
EVERYTHING
A
KNAVE
SAYS
IS
FALSE
A
STATEMENT
THAT
B
IS
A
KNIGHT
THAT
IS
THAT
Q
IS
TRUE
IS
A
LIE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
Q
IS
FALSE
AND
B
IS
ALSO
A
KNAVE
FURTHERMORE
IF
B
IS
A
KNAVE
THEN
B
STATEMENT
THAT
A
AND
B
ARE
OPPOSITE
TYPES
IS
A
LIE
WHICH
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
BOTH
A
AND
B
BEING
KNAVES
WE
CAN
CONCLUDE
THAT
BOTH
A
AND
B
ARE
KNAVES
WE

AS
IN
THIS
PUZZLE
TOGETHER
WITH
SPIES
WHO
CAN
LIE
NEXT
WE
POSE
A
PUZZLE
KNOWN
AS
THE
MUDDY
CHILDREN
PUZZLE
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
TWO
CHILDREN
EXAMPLE
A
FATHER
TELLS
HIS
TWO
CHILDREN
A
BOY
AND
A
GIRL
TO
PLAY
IN
THEIR
BACKYARD
WITHOUT
GETTING
DIRTY
HOWEVER
WHILE
PLAYING
BOTH
CHILDREN
GET
MUD
ON
THEIR
FOREHEADS
WHEN
THE
CHILDREN
STOP
PLAYING
THE
FATHER
SAYS
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
YOU
HAS
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
AND
THEN
ASKS
THE
CHILDREN
TO
ANSWER
YES
OR
NO
TO
THE
QUESTION
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHETHER
YOU
HAVE
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
THE
FATHER
ASKS
THIS
QUESTION
TWICE
WHAT
WILL
THE
CHILDREN
ANSWER
EACH
TIME
THIS
QUESTION
IS
ASKED
ASSUMING
THAT
A
CHILD
CAN
SEE
WHETHER
HIS
OR
HER
SIBLING
HAS
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
BUT
CANNOT
SEE
HIS
OR
HER
OWN
FOREHEAD
ASSUME
THAT
BOTH
CHILDREN
ARE
HONEST
AND
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
ANSWER
EACH
QUESTION
SIMULTANEOUSLY
SOLUTION
LET
BE
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
SON
HAS
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
AND
LET
D
BE
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
DAUGHTER
HAS
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
WHEN
THE
FATHER
SAYS
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
CHILDREN
HAS
A
MUDDY
FOREHEAD
HE
IS
STATING
THAT
THE
DISJUNCTION
D
IS
TRUE
BOTH
CHILDREN
WILL
ANSWER
NO
THE
FIRST
TIME
THE
QUESTION
IS
ASKED
BECAUSE
EACH
SEES
MUD
ON
THE
OTHER
CHILD
FOREHEAD
THAT
IS
THE
SON
KNOWS
THAT
D
IS
TRUE
BUT
DOES
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
IS
TRUE
AND
THE
DAUGHTER
KNOWS
THAT
IS
TRUE
BUT
DOES
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
D
IS
TRUE
AFTER
THE
SON
HAS
ANSWERED
NO
TO
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
THE
DAUGHTER
CAN
DETERMINE
THAT
D
MUST
BE
TRUE
THIS
FOLLOWS
BECAUSE
WHEN
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
IS
ASKED
THE
SON
KNOWS
THAT
D
IS
TRUE
BUT
CANNOT
DETERMINE
WHETHER
IS
TRUE
USING
THIS
INFORMATION
THE
DAUGHTER
CAN
CONCLUDE
THAT
D
MUST
BE
TRUE
FOR
IF
D
WERE
FALSE
THE
SON
COULD
HAVE
REASONED
THAT
BECAUSE
D
IS
TRUE
THEN
MUST
BE
TRUE
AND
HE
WOULD
HAVE
ANSWERED
YES
TO
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
THE
SON
CAN
REASON
IN
A
SIMILAR
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
THAT
MUST
BE
TRUE
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
BOTH
CHILDREN
ANSWER
YES
THE
SECOND
TIME
THE

WE

THAT

SO
WE
OBTAIN

WE

FINALLY
WHEN

HOWEVER
WE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
ADOPT
THE
SIMPLEST
APPROACH
THAT

USING

SOLUTION
THE

MEANS
THAT
THERE
IS

WITH
THE

WE

A

THE
FINAL

OF
THE

ESTABLISHES
THE

IN

MOVE
FROM

PROOFS
THE
ARGUMENTS
WE
INTRODUCED
IN

TO
SHOW
THAT
STATEMENTS

ARE

WERE
FORMAL
PROOFS
WHERE
ALL
STEPS
WERE

AND
THE
RULES
FOR
EACH

IN
THE
ARGUMENT
WERE
GIVEN
HOWEVER
FORMAL
PROOFS
OF
USEFUL
THEOREMS
CAN
BE
EXTREMELY
LONG
AND
HARD
TO
FOLLOW
IN

THE
PROOFS
OF
THEOREMS
DESIGNED
FOR
HUMAN
CONSUMPTION
ARE
ALMOST
ALWAYS
INFORMAL
PROOFS
WHERE
MORE

MAY
BE

IN

WHERE

MAY

WHERE
THE

AND
THE
RULES
OF

ARE
NOT
EXPLICITLY
STATED
INFORMAL
PROOFS
CAN
OFTEN
EXPLAIN
TO
HUMANS
WHY
THEOREMS
ARE
TRUE
WHILE

ARE
PERFECTLY
HAPPY
PRODUCING
FORMAL
PROOFS
USING
AUTOMATED
REASONING
SYSTEMS
THE
METHODS
OF
PROOF
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
ARE
IMPORTANT
NOT
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
USED

ALSO
FOR

MANY
APPLICATIONS
TO

THESE
APPLICATIONS

OTHER

SHOW
THAT
IF

ARE

AND

Y
ARE

THEN
BOTH
X

ARE

SOLUTION
WE
WILL
USE
PROOF
BY
CONTRAPOSITION
THE
NOTION
OF

AND

BY

FIRST
SUPPOSE
THAT

THAT
IS
ASSUME
THAT

IS
ODD
OR
THAT
Y
IS
ODD
OR
BOTH
WITHOUT

OF
GENERALITY
WE
ASSUME
THAT
X
IS
ODD
SO
THAT
X
FOR
SOME
INTEGER
K
TO
COMPLETE
THE
PROOF
WE
NEED
TO
SHOW
THAT
XY
IS

Y
IS

CONSIDER
TWO

Y

THIS
COMPLETES
THE
PROOF
BY
CONTRAPOSITION
NOTE
THAT
OUR
USE
OF
WITHOUT
LOSS
OF
GENERALITY
WITHIN
THE
PROOF
IS
JUSTIFIED
BECAUSE
THE
PROOF
WHEN
Y
IS
ODD
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
BY
SIMPLY
INTERCHANGING
THE
ROLES
OF
X
AND
Y
IN
THE
PROOF
WE
HAVE
GIVEN
COMMON
ERRORS
WITH
EXHAUSTIVE
PROOF
AND
PROOF
BY

A
COMMON
ERROR
OF
REASONING
IS
TO
DRAW
INCORRECT
CONCLUSIONS
FROM
EXAMPLES
NO
MATTER
HOW
MANY
SEPARATE
EXAMPLES
ARE
CONSIDERED
A
THEOREM
IS
NOT
PROVED
BY
CONSIDERING

UNLESS
EVERY
POSSIBLE
CASE
IS
COVERED
THE
PROBLEM
OF
PROVING
A
THEOREM
IS
ANALOGOUS
TO
SHOWING
THAT
A
COMPUTER

ALWAYS
PRODUCES
THE
OUTPUT
DESIRED
NO
MATTER
HOW
MANY
INPUT
VALUES
ARE
TESTED
UNLESS
ALL
INPUT
VALUES
ARE
TESTED
WE
CANNOT
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
PROGRAM
ALWAYS
PRODUCES
THE
CORRECT
OUTPUT
EXAMPLE
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
EVERY
POSITIVE
INTEGER
IS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH

SOLUTION
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
A
POSITIVE
INTEGER
N
CAN
BE
WRITTEN
AS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH
POWERS
OF
INTEGERS
WE
MIGHT
BEGIN
BY
EXAMINING
WHETHER
N
IS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH
POWERS
OF
INTEGERS
FOR
THE
SMALLEST
POSITIVE
INTEGERS
BECAUSE
THE
FOURTH
POWERS
OF
INTEGERS
ARE
IF
WE
CAN
SELECT
TERMS
FROM
THESE
NUMBERS
THAT
ADD
UP
TO
N
THEN
N
IS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH
POWERS
WE
CAN
SHOW
THAT
ALL
POSITIVE
INTEGERS
UP
TO
CAN
BE
WRITTEN
AS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH
POWERS
THE
DETAILS
ARE
LEFT
TO
THE
READER
HOWEVER
IF
WE
DECIDED
THIS
WAS
ENOUGH
CHECKING
WE
WOULD
COME
TO
THE
WRONG
CONCLUSION
IT
IS
NOT
TRUE
THAT
EVERY
POSITIVE
INTEGER
IS
THE
SUM
OF
FOURTH
POWERS
BECAUSE
IS
NOT
THE
SUM
OF

AS
THE

CAN
VERIFY
ANOTHER
COMMON
ERROR

MAKING
UNWARRANTED
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
LEAD
TO
INCORRECT

BECAUSE

THIS
COMPLETES
THE

SOLUTION
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS

IS
THAT
WE
MISSED
THE

WHEN

SO
THE
SUPPOSED

IF

HIS

LITTLEWOOD
AND

LITTLEWOOD
ALTHOUGH
SOME
PEOPLE
THOUGHT
THAT
HARDY
HAD
INVENTED
A
FICTITIOUS
PERSON
LITTLEWOOD
BECAUSE
LITTLEWOOD
WAS
SELDOM
SEEN
OUTSIDE
CAMBRIDGE
HARDY
HAD
THE
WISDOM
OF
RECOGNIZING
RAMANUJAN
GENIUS
FROM
UNCONVENTIONAL
BUT
EXTREMELY
CREATIVE
WRITINGS
RAMANUJAN
SENT
HIM
WHILE
OTHER
MATHEMATICIANS
FAILED
TO
SEE
THE
GENIUS
HARDY
BROUGHT
RAMANUJAN
TO
CAMBRIDGE
AND
COLLABORATED
ON
IMPORTANT
JOINT
PAPERS
ESTABLISHING
NEW

ON
THE

OF
AN

HARDY
WAS
INTERESTED
IN
MATHEMATICS
EDUCATION
AND
HIS

A

HAD
A
PROFOUND
EFFECT
ON

INSTRUCTION
IN

IN
THE
FIRST
HALF
OF
THE
TWENTIETH

HARDY
ALSO
WROTE
A

APOLOGY
IN

HE
GIVES
HIS
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
IT
IS
WORTHWHILE
TO
DEVOTE
ONE
LIFE
TO
THE
STUDY
OF

IT
PRESENTS
HARDY
VIEW
OF
WHAT
MATHEMATICS
IS

WHAT
A

DOES
HARDY
HAD
A
STRONG
INTEREST
IN

HE
WAS
AN
AVID
CRICKET
FAN
AND
FOLLOWED
SCORES

ONE
PECULIAR

WAS
THAT
HE

WE

OF

ENROLLING
IN
A
FINE
ARTS
CURRICULUM
HE
NEGLECTED
HIS

OTHER
THAN

AND
LOST
HIS

HE
FAILED
TO
PASS
EXAMINATIONS
AT
THE

FOUR
TIMES
FROM
TO
DOING

ONLY
IN

DURING
THIS
TIME
HE
FILLED
HIS

WITH
ORIGINAL
WRITINGS
SOMETIMES
REDISCOVERING
ALREADY
PUBLISHED
WORK
AND
AT
OTHER
TIMES
MAKING
NEW
DISCOVERIES
WITHOUT
A
UNIVERSITY
DEGREE
IT
WAS
DIFFICULT
FOR
RAMANUJAN
TO
FIND
A
DECENT
JOB
TO
SURVIVE
HE
HAD
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
GOODWILL
OF
HIS
FRIENDS
HE
TUTORED
STUDENTS
IN
MATHEMATICS
BUT
HIS
UNCONVENTIONAL
WAYS
OF
THINKING
AND
FAILURE
TO
STICK
TO
THE
SYLLABUS
CAUSED
PROBLEMS
HE
WAS
MARRIED
IN
IN
AN
ARRANGED

TO
A
YOUNG

NINE

HIS

NEEDING
TO
SUPPORT
HIMSELF
AND

HE
MOVED
TO
MADRAS
AND
SOUGHT
A
JOB
HE
SHOWED
HIS
NOTEBOOKS
OF
MATHEMATICAL
WRITINGS
TO
HIS
POTENTIAL
EMPLOYERS
BUT
THE

BEWILDERED
THEM
HOWEVER
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE

COLLEGE
RECOGNIZED
HIS
GENIUS
AND
SUPPORTED
HIM
AND
IN
HE
FOUND
WORK
AS
AN
ACCOUNTS
CLERK
EARNING
A
SMALL
SALARY
RAMANUJAN
CONTINUED
HIS
MATHEMATICAL
WORK
DURING
THIS
TIME
AND
PUBLISHED
HIS
FIRST
PAPER
IN
IN
AN
INDIAN
JOURNAL
HE
REALIZED
THAT
HIS
WORK
WAS
BEYOND
THAT
OF
INDIAN
MATHEMATICIANS
AND
DECIDED
TO
WRITE
TO
LEADING
ENGLISH
MATHEMATICIANS
THE
FIRST
MATHEMATICIANS
HE
WROTE

TURNED
DOWN
HIS
REQUEST
FOR

BUT
IN

HE
WROTE
TO
G

HARDY
WHO
WAS
INCLINED
TO

RAMANUJAN
DOWN
BUT
THE
MATHEMATICAL
STATEMENTS
IN

ALTHOUGH
STATED

PUZZLED
HARDY
HE
DECIDED
TO
EXAMINE
THEM
CLOSELY
WITH
THE

OF
HIS

AND
COLLABORATOR
J
E
LITTLEWOOD
THEY
DECIDED
AFTER
CAREFUL
STUDY
THAT
RAMANUJAN
WAS
PROBABLY
A
GENIUS
BECAUSE
HIS
STATEMENTS
COULD
ONLY
BE
WRITTEN
DOWN
BY
A
MATHEMATICIAN
OF
THE
HIGHEST
CLASS
THEY
MUST
BE
TRUE
BECAUSE
IF
THEY
WERE
NOT
TRUE
NO
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
THE
IMAGINATION
TO
INVENT
THEM
HARDY
ARRANGED
A
SCHOLARSHIP
FOR
RAMANUJAN
BRINGING
HIM
TO

IN
HARDY

RAMANUJAN

INFINITE

RAMANUJAN

CERTAIN

HIS

IT
WAS

WE

A

WE
INTRODUCED
THE
USE
OF

TO
SHOW
THAT
CERTAIN

ARE

WHEN

YOU
MIGHT
FIRST
TRY

THIS
CONJECTURE
AND
IF
YOUR

ARE
UNSUCCESSFUL
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
TO
FIND
A

BY
LOOKING
AT
THE
SIMPLEST
SMALLEST
EXAMPLES
IF
YOU
CANNOT
FIND
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
YOU
MIGHT
AGAIN
TRY
TO
PROVE
THE
STATEMENT
IN
ANY
CASE
LOOKING
FOR
COUNTEREXAMPLES
IS
AN
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
PURSUIT
WHICH
OFTEN
PROVIDES
INSIGHTS
INTO

WE
WILL
ILLUSTRATE
THE
ROLE
OF
COUNTEREXAMPLES
IN

IN

THAT

ALTHOUGH
WE

AS

MAYBE
WE
CAN

SOLUTION
BECAUSE

WE
MIGHT
INITIALLY
BE
SKEPTICAL
THAT
EVERY

CAN
BE
WRITTEN
AS
THE

SO
WE
FIRST
LOOK
FOR
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
THAT
IS
WE
CAN
SHOW
THAT
THE

IS
THE
SUM
OF

IS
FALSE
IF
WE
CAN
FIND
A

THAT

TO
LOOK
FOR
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
WE
TRY
TO

AS

WE
FIND
THAT
BUT
WE
CANNOT

A
WAY
TO

TO

THAT
THERE
ARE
NOT
THREE

THAT
ADD

NOTE
THAT
THE
ONLY
POSSIBLE
SQUARES
WE
CAN
USE
ARE
THOSE
NOT
EXCEEDING
NAMELY
AND
BECAUSE
NO
THREE
TERMS
WHERE
EACH

ADD
UP
TO
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
IS
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE

WE

SHOWN
THAT

THE

QUESTION
TO

IS
WHETHER

SOME

THERE
ARE

AN

NUMBER
OF
CONJECTURES
THAT
CAN

IN
THIS

TOO
TO
BEGIN
WE
NEED
TO
DEFINE
SOME
TERMS
A
CHECKERBOARD
IS
A
RECTANGLE
DIVIDED
INTO
SQUARES
OF
THE
SAME
SIZE
BY
HORIZONTAL
AND
VERTICAL
LINES
THE
GAME
OF
CHECKERS
IS
PLAYED
ON
A
BOARD
WITH

AND
COLUMNS
THIS
BOARD
IS
CALLED
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
AND
IS
SHOWN
IN
FIGURE
IN
THIS
SECTION
WE
USE
THE
TERM
BOARD
TO
REFER
TO
A
CHECKERBOARD
OF
ANY
RECTANGULAR
SIZE
AS
WELL
AS
PARTS
OF
CHECKERBOARDS
OBTAINED
BY

A
DOMINO
IS
A
RECTANGULAR
PIECE
THAT
IS
ONE
SQUARE
BY

AS
SHOWN
IN

WE
SAY
THAT
A

WHEN

ARE
COVERED
WITH
NO

AND
NO

WE
NOW
DEVELOP
SOME

ABOUT
TILING

CAN
WE
TILE
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
USING
DOMINOES
SOLUTION
WE
CAN
FIND
MANY
WAYS
TO
TILE
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
USING
DOMINOES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WE
CAN
TILE
IT
BY
PLACING
DOMINOES
HORIZONTALLY
AS
SHOWN

THERE
ARE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
OTHER

TO
DO
THIS

WE
CAN
PLACE

OR
WE
CAN
PLACE
SOME
TILES
VERTICALLY
AND
SOME
HORIZONTALLY
BUT
FOR
A
CONSTRUCTIVE

WE
NEEDED
TO

JUST
ONE
SUCH

CAN
WE
TILE
A
BOARD
OBTAINED
BY
REMOVING
ONE
OF
THE
FOUR
CORNER
SQUARES
OF
A
STANDARD
CHECKER
BOARD
SOLUTION
TO
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
NOTE
THAT
A
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
HAS
SQUARES
SO
REMOVING
A
SQUARE
PRODUCES
A
BOARD
WITH
SQUARES
NOW
SUPPOSE
THAT
WE
COULD
TILE
A
BOARD
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
BY
REMOVING
A
CORNER
SQUARE
THE
BOARD
HAS
AN
EVEN
NUMBER
OF

TILING
THE
STANDARD

FIGURE
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
WITH
THE
UPPER
LEFT
AND

BECAUSE
EACH
DOMINO
COVERS
TWO
SQUARES
AND
NO
TWO
DOMINOES
OVERLAP
AND
NO
DOMINOES
OVERHANG
THE
BOARD
CONSEQUENTLY
WE
CAN
PROVE
BY
CONTRADICTION
THAT
A
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
WITH
ONE
SQUARE
REMOVED
CANNOT
BE
TILED
USING
DOMINOES
BECAUSE
SUCH
A
BOARD
HAS
AN
ODD
NUMBER
OF
SQUARES
WE
NOW
CONSIDER
A
TRICKIER
SITUATION
EXAMPLE
CAN
WE
TILE
THE
BOARD
OBTAINED
BY
DELETING
THE
UPPER
LEFT
AND
LOWER
RIGHT
CORNER
SQUARES
OF
A
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
SHOWN
IN

SOLUTION
A
BOARD
OBTAINED
BY
DELETING
TWO
SQUARES
OF
A
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
CONTAINS
SQUARES
BECAUSE
IS
EVEN
WE
CANNOT
QUICKLY
RULE
OUT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
TILING
OF
THE
STANDARD
CHECKERBOARD
WITH
ITS
UPPER
LEFT
AND
LOWER
RIGHT
SQUARES
REMOVED
UNLIKE
EXAMPLE
WHERE
WE
RULED
OUT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF

REMOVED
TRYING
TO
CONSTRUCT
A

OF
THIS

BY
SUCCESSIVELY
PLACING
DOMINOES
MIGHT
BE
A
FIRST
APPROACH
AS
THE
READER
SHOULD
ATTEMPT
HOWEVER
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
WE
TRY
WE
CANNOT
FIND
SUCH
A

BECAUSE
OUR
EFFORTS
DO
NOT
PRODUCE
A
TILING
WE
ARE
LED
TO
CONJECTURE
THAT
NO
TILING
EXISTS
WE
MIGHT
TRY
TO
PROVE
THAT
NO
TILING
EXISTS
BY
SHOWING
THAT
WE
REACH
A
DEAD
END
HOWEVER
WE
SUCCESSIVELY
PLACE
DOMINOES
ON
THE
BOARD
TO
CONSTRUCT
SUCH
A
PROOF
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
ALL
POSSIBLE
CASES
THAT
ARISE
AS
WE
RUN
THROUGH
ALL
POSSIBLE
CHOICES
OF
SUCCESSIVELY
PLACING
DOMINOES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WE
HAVE
TWO
CHOICES
FOR
COVERING
THE
SQUARE
IN
THE
SECOND
COLUMN
OF
THE
FIRST

NEXT
TO
THE
REMOVED

WE
COULD
COVER
IT
WITH
A
HORIZONTALLY
PLACED

OR
A
VERTICALLY

EACH
OF
THESE
TWO
CHOICES
LEADS
TO
FURTHER
CHOICES
AND
SO
ON
IT
DOES
NOT
TAKE
LONG
TO
SEE
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRUITFUL
PLAN
OF

FOR
A

TO

THAT
A

WE
NEED
ANOTHER
APPROACH
PERHAPS
THERE
IS
AN
EASIER
WAY
TO
PROVE
THERE
IS
NO

OF
A
STANDARD

HOWEVER
WHEN
WE

EITHER
OF
THE
REMAINING

THAT

THE

THIS

EASY
ASSUME
THAT

JAMES
STIRLING
JAMES
STIRLING
WAS
BORN
NEAR
THE
TOWN
OF
STIRLING
SCOTLAND
HIS
FAMILY
STRONGLY
SUPPORTED
THE
JACOBITE
CAUSE
OF
THE
STUARTS
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
TO
THE
BRITISH
CROWN
THE
FIRST
INFORMATION
KNOWN
ABOUT
JAMES
IS
THAT
HE
ENTERED
BALLIOL
COLLEGE
OXFORD
ON
A
SCHOLARSHIP
IN
HOWEVER
HE
LATER
LOST
HIS
SCHOLARSHIP
WHEN
HE
REFUSED
TO
PLEDGE
HIS
ALLEGIANCE
TO
THE
BRITISH
CROWN
THE
FIRST
JACOBEAN
REBELLION
TOOK
PLACE
IN
AND
STIRLING
WAS
ACCUSED
OF
COMMUNICATING
WITH
REBELS
HE
WAS
CHARGED
WITH
CURSING
KING
GEORGE
BUT
HE
WAS
ACQUITTED
OF
THESE
CHARGES
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
COULD
NOT
GRADUATE
FROM
OXFORD
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
POLITICS
HE
REMAINED
THERE
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
STIRLING
PUBLISHED
HIS
FIRST
WORK
WHICH
EXTENDED
NEWTON
WORK
ON
PLANE
CURVES
IN
HE
TRAVELED
TO
VENICE
WHERE
A
CHAIR
OF

HAD
BEEN
PROMISED
TO
HIM
AN
APPOINTMENT
THAT
UNFORTUNATELY
FELL
THROUGH
NEVERTHELESS
STIRLING
STAYED
IN
VENICE
CONTINUING
HIS
MATHEMATICAL
WORK
HE
ATTENDED
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
PADUA
IN
AND
IN
HE
RETURNED
TO
GLASGOW
STIRLING
APPARENTLY
FLED
ITALY
AFTER
LEARNING
THE
SECRETS
OF
THE
ITALIAN
GLASS
INDUSTRY
AVOIDING
THE
EFFORTS
OF
ITALIAN
GLASS
MAKERS
TO
ASSASSINATE
HIM
TO
PROTECT
THEIR
SECRETS
IN

STIRLING
MOVED
TO
LONDON
STAYING
THERE
YEARS
TEACHING
MATHEMATICS
AND
ACTIVELY
ENGAGING
IN

IN
HE
PUBLISHED
METHODUS

HIS
MOST
IMPORTANT

IT
IS
IN
THIS

THAT
HIS
ASYMPTOTIC
FORMULA
FOR

APPEARS
STIRLING
ALSO
WORKED
ON
GRAVITATION
AND
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
EARTH
HE
STATED
BUT
DID
NOT
PROVE
THAT
THE

STIRLING
RETURNED
TO
SCOTLAND
IN
WHEN
HE
WAS
APPOINTED
MANAGER
OF
A
SCOTTISH
MINING
COMPANY
HE
WAS
VERY
SUCCESSFUL
IN
THIS

AND
EVEN
PUBLISHED
A

HE
CONTINUED
HIS
MATHEMATICAL

AT

WE
CONCLUDE
THIS

WITH
A
BRIEF

OF
A

ABOUT

IT
CAN

THAT
THE

AN

THAT

IF

WE

THERE

WE

WE
FIRST
SELECT

BECAUSE

BUT
ONCE
WE

WE
CANNOT
SELECT
EITHER

OR

BECAUSE

OVERLAP

HENCE
THIS
GREEDY
ALGORITHM
SELECTS
ONLY

THIS
IS
NOT

BECAUSE
WE

WE

TO

WE

WE

WE

EITHER

BECAUSE
NEITHER

HENCE
THIS

HOWEVER
IT
IS

WE

OF

THE

BECAUSE

THE

THIS
CAN

WHAT
IS

HOW
WE
CAN

HASHING
CONSTRUCTING
SEQUENCES

RANDOM
NUMBERS
IS
IMPORTANT
FOR
RANDOMIZED
ALGORITHMS
FOR

AND
FOR
MANY
OTHER
PURPOSES
CONSTRUCTING
A
SEQUENCE
OF
TRULY
RANDOM
NUMBERS
IS
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
OR
PERHAPS
IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE
ANY
METHOD
FOR
GENERATING
WHAT
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
RANDOM
NUMBERS
MAY
GENERATE
NUMBERS
WITH
HIDDEN

AS
A
CONSEQUENCE
METHODS
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FOR
FINDING
SEQUENCES
OF

THAT
HAVE
MANY
DESIRABLE
PROPERTIES
OF
RANDOM
NUMBERS
AND
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
VARIOUS
PURPOSES
IN

OF
RANDOM

IN
THIS
SECTION
WE
WILL
SHOW
HOW
TO
USE
CONGRUENCES
TO
GENERATE
SEQUENCES
OF
PSEUDORANDOM
NUMBERS
THE
ADVANTAGE
IS
THAT
THE
PSEUDORANDOM
NUMBERS
SO
GENERATED
ARE
CONSTRUCTED
QUICKLY
THE
DISADVANTAGE
IS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TOO
MUCH
PREDICTABILITY
TO
BE
USED
FOR
MANY
TASKS
CONGRUENCES
ALSO
CAN
BE

AND
SO
ON
WE
WILL
EXPLAIN
HOW
TO
CONSTRUCT
CHECK
DIGITS
USING
CONGRU
ENCES
FOR
A
VARIETY
OF
TYPES
OF
IDENTIFICATION
NUMBERS
WE
WILL
SHOW
THAT
THESE
CHECK

CAN
BE
USED
TO
DETECT
CERTAIN
KINDS
OF
COMMON
ERRORS
MADE

IS
TO

OF

WHERE

MEETS
THIS

WE
NEED
ONLY

FURTHERMORE
THE

SHOULD
BE

SO
THAT

WHEN
THIS
HAPPENS
WE
SAY
THAT

WAY
TO

THE

WE

THE

THE
STEPS
OF

THE
FIRST
THING
WE
DO
TO

THIS

HYPOTHESIS
P

IT

IT

THAT
IF
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT

THEN
P

THUS
A

REASONING
WHEN
WE
USE
MATHEMATICAL

TO
PROVE
A
THEOREM
WE
FIRST
SHOW
THAT

THEN
WE

THAT

FURTHER
WE

ANOTHER
WAY
TO

THE

WHY

THE
REASON
COMES
FROM

PROPERTY
LISTED
IN

AXIOM
FOR

WHICH
STATES
THAT
EVERY

N
ASSUME
THAT

THUS
BY
THE
WELL

A

WHICH

BE
DENOTED
BY

WE
KNOW
THAT
M
CANNOT
BE
BECAUSE
P
IS
TRUE
BECAUSE
M
IS
POSITIVE
AND
GREATER
THAN
M
IS
A
POSITIVE
INTEGER
FURTHERMORE
BECAUSE
M
IS
LESS

IT
IS
NOT

SO
P
M
MUST
BE

THE
GOOD
AND
THE
BAD
OF

AN
IMPORTANT
POINT
NEEDS
TO
BE
MADE
ABOUT
MATHEMATICAL
INDUCTION
BEFORE
WE
COMMENCE
A

THE
GOOD
THING
ABOUT

IS
THAT

NOT
HAVE
THE
SLIGHTEST
IDEA
WHY
IT
IS
TRUE
A
CONJECTURE
ONCE
IT
IS
HAS
BEEN
MADE

THE
BAD
THING
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
IT
CANNOT
BE
USED
TO
FIND
NEW
THEOREMS
MATHEMATICIANS
SOMETIMES

THIS

THE
MAJOR
DISADVANTAGE

IS
THAT

IS
EASY
TO
SEE
BECAUSE
A

THAT

WITH

SO
THAT

REPLACES

IS
REDUCED

AN

THE

INTRODUCTION
SUPPOSE
THAT
WE
HAVE
DESIGNED
AN
ALGORITHM
TO
SOLVE
A
PROBLEM
AND
HAVE
WRITTEN
A
PROGRAM
TO

IT
HOW
CAN
WE
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
PROGRAM
ALWAYS
PRODUCES
THE
CORRECT
ANSWER
AFTER
ALL
THE
BUGS
HAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
SO
THAT
THE
SYNTAX
IS
CORRECT
WE
CAN
TEST
THE
PROGRAM
WITH
SAMPLE
INPUT
IT
IS
NOT
CORRECT
IF
AN
INCORRECT
RESULT
IS
PRODUCED
FOR
ANY
SAMPLE
INPUT
BUT
EVEN
IF
THE

GIVES
THE
CORRECT
ANSWER
FOR
ALL
SAMPLE
INPUT
IT
MAY
NOT
ALWAYS
PRODUCE
THE
CORRECT
ANSWER
UNLESS
ALL
POSSIBLE
INPUT
HAS
BEEN
TESTED
WE

TWO

ARE
THERE
TO
PUT
FOUR

SOLUTION
WE

WE

SO
THAT

ANOTHER
WAY
TO
LOOK
AT
THIS

IS
TO
LOOK
AT
THE

WE
PUT

NOTE
THAT
THERE
ARE

HOW

SOLUTION
WE

WE

INTRODUCTION
METHODS
FOR
COUNTING
VARIOUS
TYPES
OF

WERE
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
PREVIOUS

OF

BUT
SOMETIMES

NOT

CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
THREE
PROBLEMS
FIRST
SUPPOSE
THAT
A
SALESPERSON
MUST
VISIT
SIX
DIFFERENT
CITIES
IN
WHICH
ORDER
SHOULD
THESE
CITIES
BE
VISITED
TO
MINIMIZE
TOTAL
TRAVEL
TIME
ONE
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
ORDER
IS
TO
DETERMINE
THE
TRAVEL
TIME
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
DIFFERENT
ORDERS
IN
WHICH
THE
CITIES
CAN
BE
VISITED
AND
CHOOSE
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
SMALLEST
TRAVEL
TIME
SECOND
SUPPOSE
WE
ARE
GIVEN
A
SET
OF
SIX
POSITIVE
INTEGERS
AND
WISH
TO
FIND
A
SUBSET
OF
THEM
THAT
HAS
AS
THEIR
SUM
IF
SUCH
A
SUBSET
EXISTS
ONE
WAY
TO
FIND
THESE
NUMBERS
IS
TO
GENERATE
ALL
SUBSETS
AND
CHECK
THE
SUM
OF
THEIR
ELEMENTS
THIRD
SUPPOSE
A
LABORATORY
HAS
EMPLOYEES
A
GROUP
OF
OF
THESE
EMPLOYEES
WITH
A
PARTICULAR
SET
OF
SKILLS
IS
NEEDED
FOR
A
PROJECT
EACH
EMPLOYEE
CAN
HAVE
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
THESE
SKILLS
ONE
WAY
TO
FIND
SUCH
A
SET
OF
EMPLOYEES
IS
TO
GENERATE
ALL
SETS
OF
OF
THESE
EMPLOYEES
AND
CHECK
WHETHER
THEY
HAVE
THE
DESIRED
SKILLS
THESE
EXAMPLES
SHOW
THAT
IT
IS
OFTEN
NECESSARY
TO
GENERATE
PERMUTATIONS

TO
SOLVE
PROBLEMS
GENERATING

ANY
SET
WITH

CORRESPONDENCE
WITH

WE
CAN
LIST
THE
PERMUTATIONS
OF
ANY
SET
OF

BY
GENERATING
THE
PERMUTATIONS
OF
THE

SMALLEST
POSITIVE
INTEGERS
AND
THEN
REPLACING
THESE
INTEGERS
WITH
THE
CORRESPONDING
ELEMENTS
MANY
DIFFERENT
ALGORITHMS
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
TO
GENERATE
THE

PERMUTATIONS
OF
THIS
SET
WE
WILL
DESCRIBE
ONE
OF
THESE
THAT
IS

POSITION
WHERE

SMALLER
THAN
THE
NUMBER
IN
THAT
POSITION
IN
THE
SECOND
PERMUTATION
EXAMPLE
THE
PERMUTATION
OF
THE
SET
PRECEDES
THE

BECAUSE
THESE
PERMUTATIONS

THE
FIRST
TWO
POSITIONS
BUT
THE

IN

SIMILARLY
THE

AN
ALGORITHM
FOR

BE
BASED
ON
A

OF

A
SECOND
PROBLEM
WITH
EMPIRICAL
DIFFUSION

HAS
BEEN
THAT
THEY
ARE
HIGHLY
SUBJECT
TO
SELECTION
BIAS
AS
EXAMPLES
OF

MORE
GENERALLY
WITHOUT

OF

ATTEMPTS
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO

THE
OVERALL
RATE
AT
WHICH
DIFFUSION
TAKES
PLACE
OR
HOW
MUCH
TOTAL
ADOPTION
IT
ACCOUNTS
FOR
A
MAJOR
ADVANTAGE
OF

THEREFORE
IS
THAT

OUR
OBSERVATION
THAT

BUT
THAT
THE

HAS
SEVERAL
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
THEORIES
OF

AS
THEY
APPLY
TO

AND
POSSIBLY
FOR

PROCESSES
MORE
GENERALLY
FIRST
ALTHOUGH
THE
MOTIFS
CATALOGED
IN

ARE
QUITE
LIKELY
CONSISTENT
WITH
THOSE
PREDICTED
BY

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
MODELS
FOR
SUFFICIENTLY
LOW
RATES
OF
INFECTIOUSNESS
WE
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
THE
ACADEMIC
LITERATURE
ON

HAS
PAID
LITTLE
ATTENTION
TO
THIS
LOW
INFECTIVITY
PARAMETER
RANGE
FOCUSING
INSTEAD
ON
THE
SO
CALLED
SUPERCRITICAL
PARAMETER
REGIME
WHICH
YIELDS

WATTS
KEMPE
ET
AL
LIBEN
NOWELL

KLEINBERG
AS
WE
HAVE
NOTED
THE
IMPLICIT
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THIS
FOCUS
IS
THAT
EVEN
IF
EPIDEMIC
LIKE
EVENTS
ARE
RARE
THEY
ARE
OCCASIONALLY
SO
LARGE
THAT
UNDERSTANDING
AND
PREDICTING
THEM
IS
OF
BOTH
THEORETICAL
AND
PRACTICAL
IMPORTANCE
OUR
RESULTS
CHALLENGE
THIS
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
WE
FIND
NOT
ONLY
THAT
MULTI
STEP
DIFFUSION
OCCURS
RARELY
ON
THESE
PLATFORMS
BUT
THAT
EVEN
WHEN
IT
DOES
IT
ACCOUNTS
FOR
ONLY
A
SMALL
PERCENTAGE
OF
TOTAL
ADOPTIONS
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
SUCH
THEORETICAL

OF

ARE
INTENDED
TO
EXPLAIN
TYPICAL
DIFFUSION
EVENTS
WE
THUS
ADVOCATE
MORE
EMPHASIS
ON
SUBCRITICAL

A
SECOND
RELATED
POINT
IS
THAT
EVEN
IF
ONE
COULD
EXPLICITLY
ENCODE
LOW

RATES
INTO

WE
ARGUE
THAT
DOING
SO
WOULD
IGNORE
A
KEY
SCIENTIFIC
GOAL

IDENTIFYING
THE
UNDERLYING
CAUSES
OF
THESE
OBSERVED
RATES
ELABORATING
ON
THIS
POINT
CONSIDER
A
HYPOTHETICAL

THAT

JUST
TWO
EFFECTS
THE

FOR

G
VIA

AND
THE
DEGREE
OF
SIMILARITY
IN
PRODUCT
TASTE
BETWEEN

CONTACTS
THE
DYNAMICS
OF
SUCH
A
MODEL
WOULD
THEREFORE
BE
GOVERNED
BY
TWO
COUNTERVAILING
FORCES
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
AS
INDIVIDUALS
ARE
EXPOSED
TO
MORE
PRODUCTS
THROUGH
ADVERTISING
AND
MASS
MEDIA
ADOPTIONS
DUE
TO
SOCIAL
REFERRALS
AND
HENCE
VIRAL
CASCADES
BECOME
LESS
PREVALENT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
AS
THE
PREFERENCES
OF
NETWORK
NEIGHBORS
BECOME
MORE
SIMILAR
SOCIAL
REFERRALS
EXHIBIT
MORE
VALUE
INCREASING
THE
FREQUENCY
OF

ALTHOUGH
A
FORMAL
ANALYSIS
OF
A

OF
THIS

IS
LEFT
FOR

WORK
AND
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
NO
DOUBT
MANY
OTHER
FACTORS
THAT
ONE
MIGHT
THINK
TO
INCLUDE
IN
SUCH
A

OUR
GENERAL
CLAIM
IS
THAT
BY
EXPLICITLY
MODELING
THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
ANTECEDENTS
OF

EVEN
A
RELATIVELY
SIMPLE

COULD
LEND
INSIGHT
TO
OUR
EMPIRICAL
OBSERVATIONS

SIMPLY
ASSERTING
THAT
THEY
CORRESPOND
TO
LOW

EXAMPLES
FINALLY
OUR
OBSERVATION
THAT
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
ADOPTIONS
WE
STUDY
DO
NOT
RESULT
FROM
MULTI

NATURALLY
RAISES
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
THEN
DOES
ACCOUNT
FOR
TRULY

THAT

THE

IS
OFTEN
ATTRIBUTED

ONE
POSSIBILITY
CONSISTENT
WITH

IS
THAT
EVENTS

ARE
NOT
STRICTLY
VIRAL
AT
ALL
IN
THE
SENSE

THE

EITHER

THAT

IS
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT

THEIR

A
POTENTIALLY
UNREALISTIC
ASSUMPTION
WHEN
THE

THE

OF

ONE
BROAD
LESSON
THAT
ONE
MIGHT
INFER
FROM

IS
THAT
OFTEN
IT
IS
THE

OF

RATHER

THEIR

THAT
EFFECTIVELY
PROMOTE
COOPER

FOR

COOPERA
TIVE

AND

IS

AT

IN

BUT
LIKE
HORIZONTAL

AMONG

VERTICAL
TRUST
BETWEEN

IS
CRUCIAL
FOR
THE
ACCEPTANCE
OF

ABOVE

IN
A
NARROW

PEOPLE
WANT
TO
BE
TREATED
FAIRLY
AND

FOR

A
LOCAL

MENT
WHO
LISTENS
TO
THE
CONCERNS
THAT
PEOPLE
MAY
HAVE
AND
PRO
VIDES
ACCURATE
INFORMATION
IN
A

MANNER
MIGHT
OFTEN
NOT

ENHANCE

BUT
ALSO
A
STRONGER
COMMITMENT
AND

AMONG

TO
MAKE
A
POSITIVE

TO
URGENT
SOCIAL

A
CASE
IN

IS
TYLER
AND
DEGOEY
RESEARCH
ON
THE
WATER
SHORTAGE
IN

WHICH
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
PEOPLE
EXERCISED
MORE
CONSTRAINT
ON
THEIR
WATER
CONSUMPTION
IT
THEY
FELT
TREATED
MORE
FAIRLY
BY
THE
AUTHORITIES
LIKEWISE
IT
IS
OFTEN
TRUE
THAT
RELATIVELY
SMALL
GROUPS
IN
LARGE
SOCIETIES
SUCH
AS
LOCAL
COMMUNITIES
HAVE
ENORMOUS
POTENTIAL
TO
ORGANIZE
AND
MANAGE
THEMSELVES
IN
WAYS
THAT
PROMOTE
COOPERA
TION
AND
PREVENT
THEM
FROM
DEPLETING
NATURAL

IN
SMALL

PEOPLE
ARE
ABLE
TO
DEVELOP
RULES
THAT
MATCH
THE
LOCAL
CIR
CUMSTANCES
THEY
ARE
ABLE
TO
MONITOR
ONE
ANOTHER
BEHAVIOR
AND
PUNISH
FREE
RIDING
AND
REWARD
GENEROSITY
QUITE
EFFECTIVELY
PEOPLE
CARE
VERY
STRONGLY
ABOUT
THEIR
IMAGE
OR
REPUTATION
IN
THEIR
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
AND
SO
IF
THE
NORMS
FAVOURING
COOPERATION
ARE
WELL
SPECIFIED
THEN
OFTEN
THE
MERE
PRESENCE
OF
OTHERS
MAKES
A
BIG
DIF
FERENCE
THESE
ARE
IMPORTANT
VIRTUES
OF
A
LOCAL
ORGANIZATION
FORMAL
OR
INFORMAL
RELATIVE
TO
A
MORE
GLOBAL
AUTHORITY
IT
IS
CRUCIAL
THAT
MEMBERS
OF
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
TRUST
EACH
OTHER
SO
THAT
MONITORING
AND
NORM
ENFORCEMENT
CAN
TAKE
PLACE
IS
A
COST
EFFECTIVE
INFORMAL
MANNER
THERE
IS
A
RECENT
META
ANALYTIC
STUDY
INVOLVING
SOCIETIES
THAT
PROVIDES
EVIDENCE
THAT
TRUST
AND
SOCIAL
NORM
ENFORCEMENT
MAY
REINFORCE
EACH

IN
SECURING
AND
PRO
MOTING
COOPERATION
IN
LARGE
SCALE
SOCIETIES
IN
SOCIETIES
WHERE
TRUST
IS
LOW
SUCH
AS
GREECE
OR

AFRICA
PUNISHMENT
WAS
HARDLY
EFFECTIVE
IN
PROMOTING
COOPERATION
BUT
IN

SOCIETIES
SUCH
AS
DENMARK
OR
CHINA
POSSIBILITIES
FOR
PUNISHMENT
IN
PUBLIC
GOODS
DILEMMAS
PROMOTED
COOPERATION
VERY
EFFECTIVELY
THE
BROAD
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
PUNISHMENT
IN
PROMOTING
COOPERATION
IN
A
PUBLIC
GOODS
EXPERIMENT
IS
GREATER
IN
SOCIETIES
WITH
HIGH
TRUST
RATHER
THAN
LOW
TRUST
BALLIET
VAN
LANGE
IN
PRESS
A
ANOTHER
IMPORTANT
RESULT
OF
THIS
META
ANALYSIS
IS
THAT
SOCIETIES
WITH
STRONGER
DEMOCRACIES
DEMONSTRATE
A
GREATER
ABILITY
TO
SECURE
AND
PROMOTE
CONTRIBUTIONS
TOWARDS
PUBLIC
GOODS
BY
THE
USE
OF

PUNISHMENT
THESE
FINDINGS
PAINT
A
PICTURE
IN
WHICH
THE
WAYS
IN
WHICH
INDIVIDUALS
RELATE
TO
EACH
OTHER
IN
SMALL
GROUPS
AND
LOCAL
COMMUNITIES
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
OVERALL
FUNCTIONING
OF

AND
THIS
SUGGESTS
THE
STRONG
POSITIVE
REINFORCEMENT
AMONG

THIRD

AND

AS
NOTED

MANY

IN

THE

AVOID

COLLAPSES
OSTROM
IN

IN

CONCLUSIONS
THAT
ARE
NOW
SUPPORTED
BY
A
META
ANALYTIC
STUDY
IN
PARTICULAR
AMONG
SMALLER
UNITS
SUCH
AS
DYADS
AND
SMALL
GROUPS
IT
IS
TRUST
AND
RECIPROCITY
THAT
MATTERS
AND
WE
WOULD
ADD
GENEROSITY
AND
FORGIVENESS
ALONG
WITH
EFFECTIVE
COMMUNICATION
WITHIN
A
FRAME
OF
SUFFICIENT
VERTICAL
TRUST
PEOPLE
WILL
ADOPT
AN
ACCEPTING
ATTITUDE
TO
GOVERNMENTAL
INTERVENTIONS
SUCH
AS
THE
PRO
VISION
OF

AND
SOME
CONSTRAINT

THESE
ARE
ALSO
ANALYSES
OF

CONCLUDE
THAT

THEREFORE
IT
IS

THE

THAT

ALTHOUGH
THE

THE

THAT

WHILE
MAINTAINING
THE
MINIMUM

THE

VIII
CONCLUSION
IN
THIS
PAPER
WE
PROVIDED
AN
EXTENSIVE
SURVEY
ON
THE
AVAILABLE
LITERATURE
ON
COMMUNICATIONS
IN
CELLULAR

WE
CATEGORIZED
THE

LITERATURE
BASED
ON
THE

INTO
TWO
MAJOR

THE

WERE
FURTHER
DIVIDED
INTO
UNDERLAY
AND
OVERLAY
OUTBAND
RELATED
LITERATURE
WAS
ALSO
SUB
CATEGORIZED
AS
CONTROLLED
AND
AUTONOMOUS
THE
MAJOR
ISSUE
FACED
IN
UNDERLAY
COMMUNICATION
IS
THE
POWER

AND
INTERFERENCE
MANAGEMENT
BETWEEN
AND
CELLULAR
USERS
OVERLAY
COMMUNICATION
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
INTERFERENCE
ISSUE
BECAUSE
AND
CELLULAR
RESOURCES
DO
NOT
OVERLAP
HOWEVER
THIS
APPROACH
ALLOCATES
DEDICATED
CELLULAR
RESOURCES
TO
USERS
AND
HAS
A
LOWER
SPECTRAL
EFFICIENCY
THAN
UNDERLAY
IN
OUTBAND
THERE
IS
NO
INTERFERENCE

A

TASK
WE
ALSO
DISCUSSED
THE

OF
THE

WE
POINTED
OUT
THE
SHORTCOMINGS
OF
CURRENT
WORKS
AND
PROPOSED
POTENTIAL
FUTURE
RESEARCH

OUR
SURVEY
SHOWED
THAT
COMMUNICATION
IN
CELLULAR
NETWORKS
IS
IMMATURE
AND
THERE
ARE
STILL
NUMEROUS
OPEN

SUCH
AS
INTERFERENCE
MANAGEMENT
POWER

WE
ALSO
SHED

ARE
MEN
MORE

THE
ANSWER
TO
THIS

HAS
IMMEDIATE
RELEVANCE
FOR

WE
ASSEMBLE
THE

MOST
OF

THE

THE

WE
FIND
A

THE

HOWEVER
UNDER

OF

IS

THE

FINALLY
THEY
ARE

THE
DISADVANTAGES

ARE
ESSENTIALLY
A
SLEW

THAT

BECAUSE
OF
THE
NECESSITY

HAS
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
THE
ORDER
OF

AFFECTING
THE

WE
EMPHASIZE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
GROSS
SIMPLIFICATION
OF
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
APPROACHES
AND
THAT
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
EXPOSURE
IS
CRITICALLY
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
RESEARCH

IF
THE

IS
HOW

THE
FEARS
THAT

SO

IN

DESIGNS
ARE
NOW
PRESENT
IN
BOTH

IF

THE
FORMATION

THEN
THE

WILL
NOT

AND

WHILE

WE
CAN
COMPARE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO

THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
STATISTICAL

IS
HARD
TO
COME
BY
BECAUSE
IN
A
STRICT
SENSE
EACH

CAN
ONLY

POINT
THIS
IS
EXACERBATED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
THE

BECAUSE
NO

THEY

THE

TO

THE

LESSON
HERE
IS
THAT

IF
WE
WISH
TO
USE
A
WITHIN
DESIGN
WE
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
EXPOSURE
TO
MULTIPLE
SCENARIOS
HAS
PSYCHOLOGICAL
CONSEQUENCES
HOWEVER
THE
FIXES
MAY
NOT
ALWAYS
BE
OBVIOUS
STICKING
WITH
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
WTP
ELICITATION
IMAGINE
THAT
IN
THE
BAKERY
AIRPORT
EXPERIMENT
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
WE
VARY
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
SCENARIOS
PRESENTED
TO
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
IN
THE
WITHIN
STUDY
BUT
THEIR
ELICITED
VALUE
UNDER
THE
SECOND
SCENARIO
IS
ALWAYS
BIASED
BY
THEIR
EXPOSURE
TO
THE
FIRST
POOLING
ACROSS
INDIVIDUALS
EXPOSED
TO
THE
BAKERY
FIRST
WE
HAVE
A
GOOD
MEASURE
OF
THE
BAKERY
VALUE
AND
A
BAD
MEASURE
OF
THE
AIRPORT
VALUE
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
TRUE
FOR
INDIVIDUALS
EXPOSED
TO
THE
AIRPORT
FIRST
THE
NATURAL
THING
TO
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
THROW
AWAY
THE
DIRTY
MEASURES
AND
JUST
COMPARE
THE
CLEAN
ONES
BUT
NOW
WE
ARE
BACK
TO
SQUARE
ONE
WITH
A
BETWEEN
ANALYSIS
IF
WE
AVERAGE
THE
DIRTY
AND
CLEAN
MEASURES
AND
LOOKED
AT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
ELICITED
VALUES
WE
WOULD
NEED
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
BIASES
ARE
OF
THE
SAME
SIZE
AND
DIRECTION
I
E
THE
BIAS
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
SCENARIO
KAHNEMAN
AND
RITOV
GOAL
WAS
ESTABLISHING
WTP
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
FOR
AN
ASSORTMENT
OF
PUBLIC
GOODS
THEY
USE
A
SURVEY
THAT
PRESENTS
INDIVIDUALS
WITH
A
HEADLINE
AND
THEN
ASKS
FOR
A
RESPONSE
INDIVIDUALS
REPEAT
THIS
PROCESS
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
HEADLINES
WORRIED
THAT
CARRY
OVER
AND
RANGE
EFFECTS
CONFOUND
THEIR
WITHIN
ANALYSIS
THEY
ANALYZE
THE
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
QUESTION
NUMBER
AND
RESPONSE
WITHIN
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
THEY
FIND
NO
SUBSTANTIAL
CORRELATION
AND
THUS
CONCLUDE
INDEPENDENCE
OF
RESPONSES
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
OF
PROBLEM
RECOGNITION
AND
RESPONSE
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
PERFECT
FIX
TO
THE
PROBLEM
FOR
EXAMPLE
FREDERICK
AND
FISCHHOFF
MEASURED
WTP
FOR
A
VARIETY
OF
GOODS
WITH
WITHIN
AND
BETWEEN
DESIGNS
THE
QUANTITIES
OF
EACH
GOOD
THEY
WERE
RATING
WERE
VARIED
IN
BOTH
DESIGNS
INDIVIDUALS
GOT
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
WTP
CORRECT
BETWEEN
THE
LOW
AND
HIGH
QUANTITIES
BUT
IT
WAS
MUCH
BIGGER
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
IN
THE
WITHIN
DESIGN
THE
AUTHORS
SUGGEST
THAT
IN
THE
WITHIN
DESIGN
SUBJECTS
FEEL
MORE
COMPELLED
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
THEIR
ANSWERS
BY
OBSERVING
BOTH
SCENARIOS
AT
ONCE
AND
HAVING
TO
CONTRAST
THEM
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
OF
WHY
THESE
BIASES
EXIST
COMES
FROM
THE
LITERATURE
ON
EVALUABILITY
WHEN
WE
CONSIDER
HOW
MUCH
WE
VALUE
ONE
PRODUCT
IN
ISOLATION
WE
THINK
ABOUT
THE
AMOUNT
OF
ENJOYMENT
WE
WILL
RECEIVE
WHEN
WE
CONSUME
IT
WHEN
WE
CONSIDER
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
VALUE
ONE
PRODUCT
MORE
OR
LESS
THAN
ANOTHER
WE
NEED
TO
COMPARE
THE
PRODUCTS
DIRECTLY
THE
LITERATURE
ON
EVALUABILITY
FOCUSES
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
WHEN
WE
ARE
FORCED
TO
MAKE
DIRECT
COMPARISONS
BETWEEN
PRODUCTS
THERE
MAY
BE
FEATURES
OF
THE
PRODUCTS
THAT
ARE
VERY
EASY
TO
COMPARE
THINK
SPEAKER
WATTAGE
OR
THREAD
COUNT
OF
SHEETS
AND
FEATURES
THAT
ARE
NOT
THINK
AESTHETIC
DESIGN
OF
SPEAKERS
OR
COLOR
MATCHING
WITH
SHEETS
IF
WE
OVERWEIGHT
EASILY
EVALUABLE
CHARACTERISTICS
WHEN
WE
HAVE
TO
COMPARE
TWO
PRODUCTS
DECISION
UNDER
JOINT
EVALUATION
OF
PRODUCTS
COULD
DIVERGE
FROM
DECISIONS
UNDER
SEPARATE
EVALUATION
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THIS
IDEA
TO
THE
WITHIN
VERSUS
BETWEEN
PARADIGM
IS
STRAIGHTFORWARD
BECAUSE
WITHIN
G
CHARNESS
ET
AL
JOURNAL
OF
ECONOMIC
BEHAVIOR
ORGANIZATION
DESIGNS
NECESSITATE
EXPOSURE
TO
MORE
THAN
ONE
PRODUCT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
WTP
ELICITATION
INDIVIDUALS
COULD
BE
USING
DIFFERENT
CRITERIA
TO
SUPPLY
THEIR
WTPS
IN
WITHIN
DESIGNS
THAN
IN
BETWEEN
DESIGNS
WHERE
THEY
EVALUATE
ONLY
ONE
PRODUCT
IN
ISOLATION
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
CAN
BE
EXTENDED
TO
COUNTLESS
SCENARIOS
OTHER
THAN
THE
WTP
THAT
WE
DEAL
WITH
IN
THE
LABORATORY
THESE
POINTS
ARE
MADE
CONVINCINGLY
IN
HSEE
WHO
LAYS
OUT
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
JOINT
AND
SEPARATE
EVALUATION
MODES
FOR
CONSUMPTION
FURTHER
SUPPORT
FOR
THIS
IS
PRESENTED
IN
HSEE
AND
LECLERC
WHO
USE
A
BETWEEN
DESIGNED
EXPERIMENT
IN
WHICH
SUBJECTS
ARE
EXPOSED
TO
ONE
PRODUCT
ANOTHER
PRODUCT
OR
BOTH
THEY
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
JOINT
EVALUATION
OF
PRODUCTS
LEADS
TO
DIFFERENT
VALUATIONS
THAN
SEPARATE
EVALUATIONS
THIS
IS
A
CLEAR
DEMONSTRATION
OF
ONE
OF
THE
MAJOR
CONCERNS
ABOUT
WITHIN
ANALYSES
SEE
ALSO
HSEE
AND
ZHANG
THE
MAIN
LESSON
FROM
THIS
SET
OF
STUDIES
IS
THAT
FAILING
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
COMPLEXITIES
OF
A
WITHIN
ANALYSIS
CAN
MAKE
OR
BREAK
THE
VALIDITY
OF
A
RESULT
IF
THE
ORDER
OF
ASKING
A
QUESTION
MATTERS
SIGNIFICANTLY
THEN
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
EXPERIMENTAL
ENVIRONMENT
IS
CONTRIBUTING
TO
THE
VARIATION
ACROSS
GROUPS
THIS
VARIATION
COULD
BE
FROM
CONTEXTUAL
REFERENCING
LEARNING
SENSITIZATION
TO
CHANGES
CARRY
OVER
EFFECTS
OR
OTHER
PSYCHOLOGICAL
FACTORS
IF
THIS
BIAS
IS
SPECIFIC
TO
ONE
ORDER
BUT
NOT
THE
OTHER
OR
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
ORDERS
IN
DIFFERENT
WAY
THEN
JUST
VARYING
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ENOUGH
TO
REMEDY
THE
PROBLEM
CONSIDERING
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
THREE
MAIN
ADVANTAGES
BEHIND
A
WITHIN
DESIGN
IS
ECONOMIZING
ON
SUBJECTS
THIS
IS
WORTH
BEARING
IN
MIND
AT
THE
PLANNING
STAGE
OTHER
TASKS
COULD
BE
USED
TO
HELP
RESET
AN
INDIVIDUAL
TIME
COULD
ELAPSE
BETWEEN
ELICITATIONS
OR
THE
EXPERIMENT
COULD
BE
CONDUCTED
IN
A
SEGMENTED
WAY
THE
GOAL
SHOULD
BE
TO
ACHIEVE
AN
INDEPENDENT
EVALUATION
OF
EACH
SCENARIO
BY
PARTICIPANTS
AND
IF
A
STRONG
PRESENCE
OF
THE
BIASES
DISCUSSED
IS
LIKELY
A
BETWEEN
APPROACH
MAY
BE
PREFERABLE
ANOTHER
POTENTIAL
SOURCE
OF
DIFFICULTY
IN
WTP
ELICITATION
IS
WHAT
ENVIRONMENTAL
ECONOMISTS
HAVE
TERMED
SCOPE
INSENSITIVITY
KAHNEMAN
AND
KNETSCH
AND
DESVOUSGES
ET
AL
POPULARIZED
THE
NOTION
THAT
WHEN
THE
CONTINGENT
VALUATIONS
OF

ARE
OBTAINED
BETWEEN

ALTERING
THE

THIS
WOULD

THE
POTENTIAL

THAT

ET
AL
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
IMPORTANT
LESSON
TO
BE
LEARNED
FROM
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
LITERATURE
IS
THAT
WHILE
IT
IS
EASY
FOR
A

TO
LOOK
AT

HOW

THAT

IN

THAT

THAT

THAT

THE

IT
IS

OUT
THAT
RESEARCHERS

THE

THE

THE

THE

INFORMING

RECOGNIZE
THE

INVOLVED
THERE
MAY
BE
CASES
WHERE
A
WITHIN

IS
THE
ONLY
PRACTICAL
WAY
TO
GO
HOWEVER
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
ALTHOUGH
WITHIN

LOOK
ATTRACTIVE
THE

NEED
TO
MAKE
THE
CASE
THAT
THE

DO
NOT

THIS

THERE

THE

IT

THEREFORE
THE

LET

MENTION

IF
THE

OF

THE
TASK
OF

A

OR
EVEN
OF

THE

MAY
BE

IF
THE

NOT
PRECLUDE
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
TAKING
A

THIS

WILL
TAKE

MAY
NOT

SUCH
A

AS
I
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE

ALMOST
ALL

ARE

THE

OF

THAT

WE

THE

IS
THAT

THAN

THREE
PRODUCT
ASPECTS
ARE
RELEVANT
IN
THIS
RESPECT
FIRST
THE
WAY
THEY
HAVE

THEIR
CARBON

SECONDLY
THE
WAY
THEY
HAVE
BEEN

INVENTORIES
AND
THIRDLY
WHETHER
THEIR

CAN
BE
RECOVERED
AFTER
THEIR
USE
REVERSE
LOGISTICS
FINALLY
WE
ALSO
CONSIDER
PACKAGING
AND

ITEMS
THE
OVERALL
IDEA
IS
THAT
ENVIRONMENTAL
ASPECTS
CAN
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
WHEN
CHOOSING
BETWEEN
DIFFERENT
VERSIONS
OF
THE
SAME
PRODUCT
EVEN
AT
THE

MOREOVER
THAT
BY

AND

THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
PERFORMANCE
OF
A
PRODUCT
MANUFACTURERS
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
MAKE
GREENER
PRODUCTS
THE
FIRST
ASPECT
LIFE
CYCLE
IMPACT
IS
IMPORTANT
SINCE
IT
INDICATES
THE
RESOURCES
NEEDED
TO
MAKE
THE
PRODUCT
THIS
CAN
BE
ENERGY
BUT
ALSO
OTHER
SCARCE
RESOURCES
SUCH
AS

SOME
COMPANIES
LIKE
TESCO
WALMART

THAT

THE
TOTAL
AMOUNT
OF

DIOXIDE
EMITTED

OF

OF

THE
EFFECT
IS
THAT
CONSUMERS
CAN
BASE
THEIR

SELECTION
BASED
ON
THIS
CARBON
FOOTPRINT
THE
LABELING
SEEMS
EASIER
THAN
IT
IS
THE
WHOLE

TO

ET

THE

HAS
AN
ENVIRONMENTAL

ALTHOUGH
THIS
IS
LESS
VISIBLE
THAN
THE

OF

INVENTORY
HOLDING
COSTS
PLAY
A
LARGE
PART
IN

CHAIN
DESIGN
AND
THE
MORE

IS
CENTRALIZED
THE
LESS
THE
STORAGE
COSTS
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
STORAGE
FOOTPRINT
CONSISTS
OF
COOLED
REFRIGERATED
STORAGE
FOR
FOOD
OR
HEATED
STORAGE
IN
CASE
OF
SOME
OILS
AND
EVAPORATION
DURING
STORAGE
A
CLEAR
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
CHOICES
TO
BE
MADE
IS
THE
SUPPLY
OF
TOMATOES
IN
THE
NETHERLANDS
IN
WINTER
THEY
MAY
BE
SOURCED
FROM
A
WARM
COUNTRY
FAR
AWAY
BUT
IN
THAT
CASE
MUCH
TRANSPORTATION
IS
NEEDED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THEY
MAY
ALSO
BE
PRODUCED
NATIONALLY
IN
GREENHOUSES
BUT
IN
THAT
CASE
ENERGY
IS
NEEDED
FOR
HEATING
HENCE
IT
WILL
BE
CLEAR
THAT
COMPLEX
CALCULATIONS
NEED
TO
BE
PERFORMED
TO
MAKE
OUT
WHICH
OPTION
IS
THE
BEST
FROM
AN
ENVIRONMENTAL
POINT
OF

OF

ARE
HOWEVER
SCARCE
IN

FOR

IN

YET
THIS
IS

ASPECT
IN
THE

WHEN
THE

THE

CAN

IN
THIS
WAY
SOME
OF
THE

CAN
BE
REUSED
THE
RECOVERY
TYPICALLY
INVOLVES
REVERSE

AND
THIS
WILL
BE
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
IN

WE
LIKE
TO
NOTE
THAT
THIS
ASPECT
ALSO
COMPLICATES

ASSESSMENTS
FINALLY
WE
WOULD

TO
MENTION

ITEMS
LIKE
PALLETS

ACCORDING
TO
SOME
REPORTS
PALANIVELU
AND

PACKAGING
REPRESENTS
SOME
OF
ALL

AS
ALL
PACKAGES
HAVE
TO
BE
TRANSPORTED
TO
THE
RETAILER
AS
WELL
AS
TO
THE
WASTE
PROCESSOR
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
REDUCING
PACKAGING
SAVES
THE
ENVIRONMENT
AN
ALTERNATIVE
TO
SINGLE
USE
PACKAGING
IS
RETURNABLE
PACKAGING
SUCH
AS
REFILLABLE
BOTTLES
BEER
KEGS
ETC
YET
THESE
CREATE
LOGISTIC
PROBLEMS
AS
THEY
HAVE
TO
BE
TRANSPORTED
BACK
TO
THE
PLACE
OF
ORIGIN
AND
HAVE
TO
BE
CLEANED
A
MAJOR
ISSUE
OF
ALL
THESE
RE
USABLE
ITEMS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
USED
IN
NETWORKS
AND
THEIR
INVENTORIES
NEED
TO
BE
REDISTRIBUTED
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
TOPIC
OF
SEVERAL

BECAUSE
THERE

AND
DISTANCES
ARE

WITH

DIFFICULT

DIESEL
FUELED

INTERNAL

THEREFORE
ALSO
AN

FOR

AND
IT
IS

THERE
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
MUCH
PRESSURE
FROM

AUTHORITIES
TO
REDUCE
EMISSIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
ROTTERDAM
PORT
AUTHORITIES
CONTRACTUALLY
OBLIGE
A
SUBSTANTIAL
REDUCTION
IN

WHEN

THE

THAT

THE

THIS

IS

ATTRACTED
BY
THE

FACTORS
WHICH
ARE

CANNOT

UNLESS
THE

THE
RISK
OF

IS
A
SERIOUS
HINDRANCE

THAT
THE

WHETHER

FOR

THE
OTHER
ISSUE
RELATED
TO

IS
THAT
ESTABLISHING

INDICATES
THAT
BOTH

PARTIES
HAVE
DEVELOPED
MUTUAL
TRUST
AIMING
FOR

MUTUAL

FROM

SUCH
MUTUAL

ONE
OF
THE
EXAMPLES
WHICH

OF

TO
COMPLEMENT
THEIR
INTERNAL
CAPABILITIES
WITH
OTHER
CAPABILITIES
WHICH
THEY
CANNOT

INTERNALLY
IN
ORDER
TO

THE
EFFECTIVE
WAY
TO

SUCH

IS
BY

RELATIONSHIPS

TWO

FORMS
OF

IN
OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS
I
E
FORWARD
AND
BACKWARD
RESPECTIVELY
FORWARD
INTEGRATION
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
PHYSICAL
FLOWS
OF
MATERIALS
FROM
SUPPLIERS
TO
MANUFACTURERS
WHICH
WE
REFER
TO

INTEGRATION
ON
THE
OTHER

BACKWARD
INTEGRATION
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
COORDINATION
OF
INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGIES
AND
THE
FLOWS
OF
INFORMATION
FROM
MANUFACTURERS
TO
SUPPLIERS
AS
CLARIFIED
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
THIS
STUDY
ASSUMES
THAT
INFORMATION
AND
MATERIAL
FLOW
IN
OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS
WITHIN
SUPPLY

PIPELINE
WITH
MATERIAL
HAVING
FORWARD
FLOW
WHILE
INFORMATION
HAVING
BACKWARD
FLOW
HOWEVER
TODAY
THE
FLOWS
OF
BOTH
INFORMATION
AND
MATERIAL
HAVE
EXPANDED
INTO
BOTH
DIRECTIONS
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
CONCEPT
OF
REVERSE

DENOTES
THAT
THE

IS
NOW
GOING

IN

THE

THE

ALSO

FUTURE

CAN
EXPLORE
THE

FLOWS
OF

WHICH
MAY
NEED
A

MODEL
OF

INTEGRATION
A
LIMITATION
OF
THIS
STUDY
IS
THE
SAMPLE
POPULATION
WHICH
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
AUSTRALIAN
FIRMS
ALTHOUGH
WE
EXPECT
THESE
RESULTS
TO
HOLD
FOR
SUPPLY
CHAINS
IN
GENERAL
WE
CANNOT
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
THEREFORE
FUTURE
RESEARCH
MAY
EXTEND
THIS
STUDY
TO
A
BROADER
POPULATION
OF
FIRMS
INCLUDING
OTHER

FOR
GENERALIZABILITY
OF
THE
RESULTS
AND
TO

EFFECTS
ALSO
IN
THIS

WE
RELY
ON
THE
PERCEPTION
OF
THE
FOCAL

ON
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
IT
WOULD
BE
BENEFICIAL
TO

MULTIPLE
PARTIES
OF
SUPPLY
CHAIN
RELATIONSHIPS
TO
HEAR
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
STORY
CONCERNING
ISSUES
OF
RECIPROCITY
AND
MUTUAL
EFFECTS
CONCLUSIONS
THIS
STUDY
SHOWS
THAT
BOTH
INFORMATION
AND
MATERIAL
FLOW
INTEGRATION
ARE
IMPORTANT
FOR
SUPPLY
CHAIN
INTEGRATION
HAVING
SIGNIFICANT
EFFECTS
ON
PERFORMANCE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
SUPPLY
CHAIN
INTEGRATION
IS
A
DIFFICULT
TASK
AS
IT
INVOLVES
MANY
MANAGEMENT
ASPECTS
IN

OF
BOTH
HARD

SOFT
INFORMATION

MECHANISMS
IN

OF
THE
LOGISTICS
INTEGRATION
ACTIVITIES
CONCERNING
THE
PHYSICAL

BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PARTIES
SUCH
COMPLEX
ISSUES
CAN
ONLY
BE
MANAGED
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
LONG
TERM
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
SUPPLY
CHAIN
PARTNERS
THIS
STUDY
THEREFORE
REINFORCES
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
BUILDING
LONG

RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
SUPPLIERS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
PROMOTED
SINCE

IT

IN

THERE

AT

A

OF

USING

WE

A

AFFORDS

TO
REASON
THAT
IT
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO

SO
IF
WE
CAN
PROVE
THAT

WE
HAVE

IT
FOR

FOLLOWING
THE
PROCEDURE
OUTLINED
UNDER

TO

THAT

WE

THAT
THE

THE

BE
THOUGHT

EACH

TAKE

THE

WHETHER

WE
CAN

WE
CAN
APPLY
THE

REASONING
AS

TO
SAY
THAT
THE

IS

IT

NOTICE
HOWEVER
THAT
THE

VALUE
DOES
NOT

FOR

IS

REQUIREMENT
FOR
A
NULL
RECURRENT
STATE
IS
AN
INFINITE
SET
OF

WHICH
WE
HAVE
A
POSSIBLE
INTUITION
IS
THAT
