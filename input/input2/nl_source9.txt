APPROACHES

THIS

THE

IS
TO

OF

EXAMPLES

THE
HIGH

ARE

PLACED
IN

POSITIONS

AS

AND

DIB
ET

STEWART
ET
AL

ET

THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
FIRST
APPROACH
IS
THAT
RESOLUTION
IS
MAXIMIZED

IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
ODDS

MICROSATELLITES
IN

STARTING

THE

BOUNDARIES
CON
VERSION

OF

IN
COMPREHENSIVE

SUCH
AS

BECAUSE

A

IS

WHEN

THE

CAN
BE
DEFINED
COMMONLY

FOR
ANCHORING
A

IN

THE

A

THE

IT
IS

ONE
SOLUTION
IS
TO
USE
MASSIVELY
PARALLEL
COMPUTERS

OTHER

BUT
FOR
THE

OF
THIS

WE
WILL
CONSIDER
ONLY
WHAT

COMPUTERS
WITH

IT

NECESSARY

BUT
WITH
A
SMALL
RISK
THAT

BE

ONE

THE

VIRTUALLY
ALL

IN

TODAY
WILBUR

THE
BASIC
IDEA
IS
THAT
AN
ALIGNMENT
REPRESENTING
A
TRUE

CONTAIN
AT

ONE

THAT
IS
COMMON
TO

THESE

THE

THE

INTRODUCTION
WHEN
A
PROTEIN
SEQUENCE
IS
NEWLY
DETERMINED
AN
IMPORTANT
GOAL
IS
TO
ASSIGN
POSSIBLE
FUNCTIONS
TO
THE
PROTEIN
THE
FIRST
COMPUTATIONAL
STEP
IS
TO
SEARCH
FOR
SIMILARITIES
WITH
SEQUENCES
THAT
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
BEEN
DEPOSITED
IN
THE
DNA
AND
PROTEIN
SEQUENCE
DATABASES
IF
SIMILAR
SEQUENCES
ARE
FOUND
THEY
MAY
MATCH
THE
COMPLETE
LENGTH
OF
THE
NEW
SEQUENCE
OR
ONLY
TO
SUBREGIONS
OF
THE
SEQUENCE
IF
MORE
THAN
ONE
SIMILAR
SEQUENCE
IS
FOUND
THEN
THE
NEXT
IMPORTANT
STEP
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
TO
MULTIPLY
ALIGN
ALL
OF
THE
SEQUENCES
MULTIPLE

ARE
A
KEY

FOR

CLUES
ABOUT

ARE

FOR

AND
WHICH
ARE
IMPORTANT
FOR
STABILIZING
THE
SECONDARY

IN
THIS
CHAPTER
SOME

ARE

TOWARD
THE

AND

OF

MULTIPLE

THIS
IS
NOT
A
COMPREHENSIVE
REVIEW
OF
TECHNIQUES
RATHER
IT
IS
A
GUIDE
BASED
ON
THE
SOFTWARE
THAT
HAVE
PROVEN
TO
BE
MOST
USEFUL
IN
BUILDING
ALIGNMENTS
AND
USING
THEM
TO
PREDICT

A

WHEN
THE
RESIDUES
IN
ONE
SEQUENCE
ARE
LINED
UP
WITH
THOSE
IN
AT
LEAST
ONE
OTHER
SEQUENCE
OPTIMAL
ALIGNMENT
OF
THE
TWO
SEQUENCES
WILL
USUALLY
REQUIRE
THE
INSERTION
OF
GAPS
IN
ONE
OR
BOTH
SEQUENCES
IN
ORDER
TO
FIND
THE
BEST
ALIGNMENT
ALIGNMENT
OF
TWO
RESIDUES
IMPLIES
THAT
THOSE
RESIDUES
ARE
PERFORMING
SIMILAR
ROLES
IN
THE
TWO
DIFFERENT
PROTEINS
THIS
ALLOWS
FOR
INFORMATION
KNOWN
ABOUT
SPECIFIC
RESIDUES
IN
ONE
SEQUENCE
TO
BE
POTENTIALLY
TRANSFERRED
TO
THE
RESIDUES
ALIGNED
IN
THE
OTHER
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
ACTIVE
SITE
RESIDUES
OF
AN
ENZYME
HAVE
BEEN
CHARACTERIZED
ALIGNMENT
OF
THESE
RESIDUES
WITH
SIMILAR
RESIDUES
IN
ANOTHER
SEQUENCE
MAY
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
SECOND
SEQUENCE
POSSESSES
SIMILAR
CATALYTIC
ACTIVITY
TO
THE
FIRST
THE
VALIDITY
OF
SUCH
HYPOTHESES
DEPENDS
ON
THE
OVERALL
SIMILARITY
OF
THE
SEQUENCES
WHICH
IN
TURN
DICTATE
THE
CONFIDENCE
WITH
WHICH
AN
ALIGNMENT
CAN
BE
GENERATED
THERE
ARE
TYPICALLY
MANY
MILLIONS
OF
DIFFERENT
POS
SIBLE
ALIGNMENTS
FOR
ANY
TWO
SEQUENCES
THE
TASK
IS
TO
FIND
AN
ALIGNMENT
THAT
IS
MOST
LIKELY
TO
REPRESENT
THE
CHEMICAL
AND
BIOLOGICAL
SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PROTEINS
A
MULTIPLE
SEQUENCE
ALIGNMENT
IS
SIMPLY
AN
ALIGNMENT
THAT
CONTAINS
MORE
THAN
TWO
SEQUENCES
EVEN
IF
ONE
IS
INTERESTED
IN
THE
SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN
ONLY
TWO
OF
THE
SEQUENCES
IN
A
SET
IT
IS
ALWAYS
WORTH
MULTIPLY
ALIGNING
ALL
AVAILABLE
SEQUENCES
THE
INCLUSION
OF
THESE
ADDITIONAL
SEQUENCES
IN
THE
MULTIPLE

WILL
NORMALLY

PROVE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE

THE

IS
WHAT

THE

THE
ADVANTAGE

THIS
AFTER

INVOLVING

IS
WHAT
I
MEAN
BY
THE

FILLER
TRIALS
IN
WHICH
THEY
MEASURED
THE

THE

DOES
NOT

THAT
THEY
ONLY
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER

ONE
EXPLANATION
OF
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
FIRST
MENTION
DRAWS
ON
THE
PROPOSAL
THAT
COMPREHENSION
INVOLVES
LAYING
A
FOUNDATION
FOR
THIS
REASON
FIRSTMENTIONED
PARTICIPANTS
ARE
MORE
ACCESSIBLE
BOTH
BECAUSE
THEY
FORM
THE

FOR

REPRESENTATIONS

BECAUSE

THEM

HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
OTHER
EXPLANATIONS

THE

THESE
OTHER
EXPLANATIONS
DRAW
ON
THE
LINGUISTIC
STRUCTURE
OF

FOR
EXAMPLE
FIRST
MENTIONED
PARTICIPANTS
MIGHT
BE
MORE

BECAUSE
IN

DECLARATIVE
SENTENCES
THEY
ARE
VIRTUALLY
ALWAYS
THE
SYNTACTIC
RELATION
KNOWN

TINA
WAS

BY

IN

THE
CRUCIAL
FACTOR

WHETHER

HAD
FINISHED
MAPPING
THE

ONTO
THE

THE

AN

EXPLANATION

THAT
THE

OF

I
SUGGEST
THAT

THIS
GOAL
WAS
MET
BY

FIRST
FOUR

THE
FIRST
EXPERIMENT
DEMONSTRATED
THAT

THE

OF

TO

EXPLANATIONS
WERE

THE
FIRST
WAS
THE

MAJOR

OVER
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
SECOND
CLAUSES
THE
PRONOUNS
SUPPRESSED
THEIR
NONANTECEDENTS
ONE
REASON
THAT
THESE
PRONOUNS
MIGHT
HAVE
TAKEN
LONGER
TO
SUPPRESS
THEIR
NONANTECEDENTS
IS
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
UNTIL
THE
SECOND
CLAUSE
THAT
THE
PRONOUNS
WERE
SEMANTICALLY
DISAMBIGUATED
THAT
IS
PRIOR
TO
THE
SECOND
CLAUSE
THE
PRONOUNS
COULD
HAVE
REFERRED
TO
EITHER
SENTENCE
PARTICIPANT
HOWEVER
A
FO
URTH
EXPERIMENT
DEMONSTRATED
VERY
SIMILAR
RESULTS
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
PRONOUNS
WERE
DISAMBIGUATED
BY
A
PRIOR
SEMANTIC
CONTEXT
AS
IN

GERNSBACHER
BILL
LOST
A
TENNIS
MATCH
TO
JOHN
ACCEPTING
THE
DEFEAT
HE
WALKED
QUICKLY
TOWARD
THE
SHOWERS
OR
ENJOYING
THE
VICTORY
HE
WALKED
QUICKLY
TOWARD
THE
SHOWERS
A
FIFTH
EXPERIMENT
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
PRONOUNS
STILL
DO
NOT
EMPLOY
SUPPRESSION
IMMEDIATELY
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
MATCH
THE
GENDER
OF
ONLY
ONE
PARTICIPANT
AS
IN
TIM
PREDICTED
THAT
PAM
WOULD
LOSE
THE
TRACK
RACE
BUT
SHE
CAME
IN
FIRST
VERY
EASILY
BUT
ONCE
THEY
DO
EMPLOY
SUPPRESSION
IT
IS
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
WHEN
THE
PRONOUNS
ARE
NOT
GENDER
DISAMBIGUATED
THE
SIXTH
AND
FINAL
EXPERIMENT
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
REMENTIONED
PARTICIPANTS
ARE
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
IMPROVE
THEIR
REFERENTIAL
ACCESS
BY
SUPPRESSING
OTHER
PARTICIPANTS
NEWLY
INTRODUCED
PARTICIPANTS
DO
SO
AS
WELL
THAT
IS
INTRODUCING
A
NEW

AS
IN
HAS
THE
SAME
EFFECT
AS
REMENTIONING
AN

AS
IN

THIS
MOST
OF

MORTON

IN

WE

DOES
INTRODUCING

AS

THE
MORE
TYPICAL
A
MAKE
THAT
CONCEPT
MORE

TO

THIS
QUESTION
WE
AUDITORILY
PRESENTED

NARRATIVES
TO
SUBJECTS
TELLING
THEM
THAT
AT
SOME
POINT
IN
EACH

THE
NARRATOR
WOULD
STOP
TALKING
WHEN
THAT
HAPPENED
IT
WAS
THEIR
JOB
TO
CONTINUE
TELLING
THE

WE
CONSTRUCTED
OUR

SO
THAT
THE

INTRODUCED
A
NEW

WE
MAN
IPULATED
WHETHER
THIS

WAS

THESE

THAT

THEREFORE
THE

CLEARLY
THIS

RAPIDLY

THAT
TWO

GENERAL
COGNITIVE

THE
ADVANTAGE
OF

INVOLVING
TWO
PARTICIPANTS
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
ACCESS
THE
FIRST
MENTIONED

THE

I
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ADVANTAGE
ARISES
BECAUSE
COMPREHENSION
INVOLVES
LAYING
A
FOUNDATION
AND
FOR
THIS
REASON
FIRSTMENTIONED
PARTICIPANTS
ARE
MORE
ACCESSIBLE
BOTH
BECAUSE
THEY
FORM
THE
FOUNDATIONS
FOR
THEIR
SENTENCE
LEVEL
REPRESENTATIONS
AND
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THROUGH
THEM
THAT
SUBSEQUENT
INFORMATION
IS
MAPPED
ONTO
THE
DEVELOPING
REPRESENTATION
THE
PROCESS
OF
LAYING
A

ACCOUNTS
FOR
THE
CHANGE
IN

OF
CONCEPTS

WHEN
COMPREHENDERS
ARE
STILL

THEIR
REPRESENTATIONS
OF
A
FINAL
CLAUSE
CONCEPTS
IN
THAT
FINAL
CLAUSE
ARE
MORE
ACCESSIBLE
THAN
CONCEPTS
FROM
AN
INITIAL
CLAUSE
AFTER
COMPREHENDERS
HAVE

THEIR

THAT
AT

THE

THAT

TO
THE

A

THE

THUS

BY

IT
IS
POSSIBLE
AS
WE
SUGGESTED
EARLIER
THAT
SOME
OF
THE

ATTRIBUTED

ALONE
ARE
PARTLY
DUE
TO

OF

HAVE

THAT

A

COULD
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
A
CLOSER
PHONOLOGICAL

BETWEEN

THAN
BETWEEN

THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CLEAR

FOR

AMONG
THESE
ALTERNATIVES
AND
THAT
IS
A
GENERAL
PROBLEM
THAT
IS
PREDICTED
BY
THE
FIT
HYPOTHESIS
BEYOND
THE
CLEAR
DEMONSTRATION
OF

ACROSS

IS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER

MATTERS
FOR

TO

WE
BEGAN
WITH
THE
OBSERVATION
THAT
LEARNING
TO

CAN
BE
DIFFICULT
COMPARED
WITH
LEARNING
LANGUAGE
DO
SOME
WRITING
SYSTEMS
MAKE
LEARNING
TO
READ
MORE
DIFFICULT
THAN
OTHER
WRITING
SYSTEMS
OR
IF

CHOOSE
WRITING
THAT
FITS
THEN
SHOULD
LEARNING

FACE
MORE
OR
LESS
SIMILAR
CHALLENGES
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
WRITING
SYSTEM
LEARNING

IS
OFTEN
DEFINED
AS
LEARNING
TO
GET

FROM

THIS
IS
FINE
AS
FAR
AS
IT
GOES
BUT
IT
BEGS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
LEARNED
FROM
OUR
PERSPECTIVE
A
DEFINITION
PROPOSED
BY
PERFETTI
AND
ZHANG
IS
MORE
APT
LEARNING

HOW

THAT
IS

WHEN
THAT

PROCEDURALLY
THE

IS
INDEED
GETTING

WITH
THIS

THE

HOW

AS
TO
TAKE

WHETHER
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
IS
TRUE
OR
EVEN
TESTABLE
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
BUT
IT
AT

BECOMES
A

QUESTION
WOULD

BE
EASIER

RATHER
THAT
THE

BOOTSTRAP
THEIR

THAT
WRITING

SOUNDS
JAPANESE
PROVIDES
A
NATURAL
TEST
OF

BECAUSE
WHEREAS

THE

TO

ME
THIS
WAS
THE

ALMOST
UNTOUCHED
TINOCO
HAD
PUBLISHED
THE

OF

THAT
WAS
IT
BY
THE

OF

HAD
SEEN
THE

THAT
USE
FLOATING
POINT
ARITHMETIC
IN
HE
COMPLETELY
CHANGED
HIS
RE
SEARCH
FOCUS
AFTER
PICKING
BIOINFORMAT
MY
REASON
FOR
WANTING
A
COMPLETE
CHANGE
WAS
SIMPLY
TO
BRING
MORE
ADVENTURE
AND
EXCITEMENT
INTO
MY
LIFE
BIOINFORMATICS
WAS
ATTRACTIVE
BECAUSE
I
HAD
NO
IDEA
WHAT
THE
FIELD
WAS
ALL
ABOUT
AND
BECAUSE
NEITHER
DID
ANYONE
ELSE
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
CATALYST
WAS
HIS
FRIENDSHIP
WITH
GENE
MYERS
WHO
WAS
ALREADY
WORK
ING
IN
THE
NEW
AREA
IT
WASN
T
EVEN
CALLED
BIOINFORMATICS
THEN
MILLER
WAS
SWITCHING
TO
A
FIELD
WITHOUT
A
NAME
HE
LOVED
THE
FRONTIER
SPIRIT
OF
THE
EMERG
ING
DISCIPLINE
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
DOING
SOMETHING
USEFUL
FOR
MANKIND
THE
CHANGE
WAS
DIFFICULT
FOR
ME
BECAUSE
I
WAS
COMPLETELY
IGNORANT
OF
BIOLOGY
AND
STATISTICS
IT
TOOK
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
BEFORE
I
REALLY
STARTED
TO
UNDERSTAND
BIOLOGY
I
M
NOW
ON
THE
FACULTY
OF
A
BIOLOGY
DEPARTMENT
SO
IN
SOME
SENSE
I
SUCCESSFULLY
MADE
THE
TRANSITION
UNFORTUNATELY
I
M
STILL
BASICALLY
IGNORANT
OF
STATISTICS
IN
ANOTHER
RESPECT
THE
CHANGE
WAS
EASY
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
SO
LITTLE
ALREADY
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
FIELD
I
READ
A
FEW
PAPERS
BY
MIKE
WATERMAN
AND
DAVID
SANKOFF
AND
WAS
OFF
AND
RUNNING
MILLER
CAME
TO
THE
NEW
FIELD
ARMED
WITH
TWO
SKILLS
THAT
PROVED
VERY
USE
FUL
AND
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
IDEAS
THAT
HELPED
FOCUS
HIS
RESEARCH
INITIALLY
THE
SKILLS
WERE
HIS
MATHEMATICAL
TRAINING
AND
HIS
EXPERIENCE
WRITING
COMPUTER
PROGRAMS
THE
FIRST
IDEA
THAT
HE
BROUGHT
TO
THE
FIELD
WAS
THAT
AN
OPTIMAL
ALIGNMENT
BETWEEN
TWO
SEQUENCES
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
IN
SPACE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
LONGER
SEQUENCE
IT
IS
STRAIGHTFORWARD
TO
COMPUTE
THE
SCORE
OF
AN
OPTIMAL
ALIGNMENT
IN
THAT
AMOUNT
OF
SPACE
BUT
IT
IS
MUCH
LESS
OBVIOUS
HOW
TO
PRODUCE
AN
ALIGNMENT
WITH
THAT
SCORE
A
VERY
CLEVER
LINEAR
SPACE
ALIGNMENT
ALGORITHM
HAD
BEEN
DISCOVERED
BY
DAN
HIRSCHBERG
AROUND
THE
OTHER
IDEA
WAS
THAT
WHEN
TWO
SEQUENCES
ARE
VERY
SIMILAR
AND
WHEN
ALIGNMENTS
ARE
SCORED
RATHER
SIMPLY
AN
OPTIMAL
ALIGNMENT
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
MUCH
MORE
QUICKLY
THAN
BY
DYNAMIC
PROGRAMMING
USING
A
GREEDY
ALGO
RITHM
THAT
IDEA
WAS
DISCOVERED
INDEPENDENTLY
BY
GENE
MYERS
WITH
SOME
PRODDING
FROM
MILLER
AND
ESKO
UKKONEN
IN
THE
MID
MILLER
HOPED
THAT
THESE
TWO
IDEAS
OR
VARIANTS
OF
THEM
WOULD
GET
HIM
STARTED
IN
THE
NEW
FIELD
HE
HAD
SOLUTIONS
IN
SEARCH
OF
BIOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS
RATHER
THAN
BIO
LOGICAL
PROBLEMS
IN
SEARCH
OF
SOLUTIONS
INDEED
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
MODE
OF
ENTRY
INTO
BIOINFORMATICS
FOR
SCIENTISTS
TRAINED
IN
A
QUANTITATIVE
FIELD
DURING
HIS
FIRST
DECADE
IN
BIOINFORMATICS
MILLER
COAUTHORED
A
FEW
PAPERS
ABOUT
LINEAR
SPACE
ALIGNMENT
METHODS
FINDING
A
NICHE
FOR
GREEDY
ALGO
RITHMS
TOOK
LONGER
BUT
FOR
COMPARING
VERY
SIMILAR

SEQUENCES
PARTIC
ULARLY
WHEN
THE

BETWEEN
THEM
IS
DUE
TO
SEQUENCING

RATHER

THEY
ARE
QUITE
USEFUL
THEY
DESERVE

IN

THAN
THEY
NOW
HAVE
THE
MOST

OF
MILLER
BIOINFORMATICS
PROJECTS
HAVE
INVOLVED
IDEAS
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONES
HE
BROUGHT
WITH
HIM
TO
THE

HIS
MOST
WIDELY
KNOWN
PROJECT
WAS
THE
COLLABORATION
TO
DEVELOP
THE

PROGRAM
WHERE
IT
WAS
DAVID

THAT
DROVE
THE
PROJECT
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
HOW
EVER
IT
IS
MILLER
WORK
ON
COMPARISON
METHODS
FOR
LONG

SEQUENCES
THAT
BROUGHT
HIM
CLOSER
TO

AND
MADE
MILLER
ALGORITHMS
A
HOUSEHOLD
NAME
AMONG
TEAMS
OF
SCIENTISTS
ANALYZING
MAMMALIAN
AND
OTHER
WHOLE
GENOME
SEQUENCES
MILLER
PICKED
THIS
THEME
AS
HIS
HOLY
GRAIL
AROUND
AND
HE
HAS
STUCK
WITH
IT
EVER
SINCE
WHEN
HE
STARTED
THERE
WERE
ONLY
TWO
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WORLD
BRAVE
OR
FOOLISH
ENOUGH
TO
PUBLICLY
ADVOCATE
SEQUENC
ING
THE
MOUSE
GENOME
AND
COMPARING
IT
WITH
THE
HUMAN
GENOME
MILLER
AND
HIS
LONG
TERM
COLLABORATOR
THE
BIOLOGIST
ROSS
HARDISON
THEY
OCCASION
ALLY
WENT
SO
FAR
AS
TO
TOUT
THE
SEQUENCING
OF
SEVERAL
ADDITIONAL
MAMMALS
NOWADAYS
IT
LOOKS
TO
EVERYONE
LIKE
THE
GENOME
SEQUENCING
OF
MOUSE
RAT
CHIMPANZEE
DOG
AND
SO
ON
WAS
INEVITABLE
BUT
PERHAPS
MILLER
MANY
YEARS
OF
WORKING
ON
PROGRAMS
TO
COMPARE
GENOME
SEQUENCES
MADE
THE
INEVITABLE
HAPPEN
SOONER
WHAT
WORKED
BEST
FOR
MILLER
WAS
TO
ENVISION
AN
ADVANCE
IN
BIOINFORMAT
ICS
THAT
WOULD
FOSTER
NEW
BIOLOGICAL
DISCOVERIES
NAMELY
THAT
DEVELOPMENT
OF
METHODS
TO
COMPARE
COMPLETE
MAMMALIAN
GENOME
SEQUENCES
WOULD
LEAD
TO
A
BETTER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
EVOLUTION
AND
OF
GENE
REGULATION
AND
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
HE
COULD
THINK
OF
TO
MAKE
IT
HAPPEN
THIS
INCLUDED
DEVELOPING
ALGORITHMS
THAT
WOULD
EASILY
ALIGN
THE
LONGEST
SEQUENCES
HE
COULD
FIND
AND
HELPING
ROSS
HARDISON
TO
VERIFY
EXPERIMENTALLY
THAT
THESE
ALIGNMENTS
ARE
USEFUL
FOR
STUDYING
GENE
REGULATION
WHEN
MILLER
AND
HARDISON
DECIDED
TO
SHOW
HOW
ALIGNMENTS
AND
DATA
FROM
BIOLOGICAL
EXPERIMENTS
COULD
BE
LINKED
THROUGH
A
DATABASE
THEY
LEARNED
ABOUT
DATABASES
WHEN
THEY
WANTED
TO
SET
UP
A
NETWORK
SERVER
TO
ALIGN
DNA
SEQUENCES
THEY
LEARNED
ABOUT
NETWORK
SERVERS
WHEN
NOBODY
IN
HIS
LAB
WAS
AVAILABLE
TO

THAT
THEY
NEEDED
MILLER
WROTE
IT
HIMSELF
WHEN
INVENTING

SEEMED
IMPORTANT
HE
WORKED
ON
IT
THE

CHANGED
BUT
THE

REMAINED
CONSTANT
MILLER
HAS
BEEN
MORE
SUCCESSFUL

BEFORE

WE
DECIDED
THAT
THE

USING

THE

TO

WE

THERE
WAS

IN

LEVEL
OF

WITH
INTERVENTIONS
SCORING
BELOW

AND

SCORING

OUR
LAST
RESEARCH
QUESTION
WAS

IN

THE
ISSUE
OF

INTERESTINGLY
THE
FIRST
TWO
MODELS
INCLUDING
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
INTERVENTION
AND
THE
INTERACTION
WITHIN
THE

WERE
NOT

IT
WAS
ONLY
WHEN
ASPECTS
RELATING

EMPLOYED
WERE
ENTERED
THAT

IN
THE

MODEL
AN
RCT
AS
OPPOSED
TO
AN
OBSERVATIONAL
STUDY
SIGNIFICANTLY
PREDICTED

A
LIKELY
EXPLANATION
IS
THAT
THE
OBSERVATIONAL
STUDIES
IN
OUR
REVIEW
WERE
MAINLY
SMALL
PILOT
STUDIES
AND
LARGE
REAL
LIFE
STUDIES
PILOT
STUDIES
ARE
LIKELY
TO
SHOW
LOWER
ADHERENCE
RATES
BECAUSE
THE
INTERVENTIONS
ARE
NOT
FULLY
TESTED
AND
ARE
IMPROVED
AFTER
THE
OUTCOMES
OF
THE
PILOT
ARE
KNOWN
REAL
LIFE
OBSERVATIONAL
STUDIES
HAVE
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
HAVE
LOWER
ADHERENCE
RATES
WHICH
SUGGESTS
THAT
THE
FORMAL
STRUCTURE
OF
A
TRIAL
IS
IMPORTANT
FOR
PARTICIPANTS
TO
ADHERE
TO
AN
INTERVENTION
FURTHERMORE
THE
SELECTION
PROCESSES
OF
MANY
RCTS
MAKE
IT
LIKELY
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
BOTH
SETTINGS
WHICH
CONTRIBUTES
TO
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
ADHERENCE
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
A
COUNSELOR
WAS
A
SIGNIFICANT
PREDICTOR
OF
ADHERENCE
THIS
FINDING
CONCURS
WITH
REVIEWS
OF
BROUWER
SCHUBART
AND
OTHER
STUDIES
FOR
AN
OVERVIEW
SEE
THAT
CONCLUDE
THAT
COUNSELOR
OR
CLINICIAN
SUPPORT
IS
RELATED
TO
GREATER
EXPOSURE
AND
ENGAGEMENT
OF
THE
SIGNIFICANT
PREDICTORS
IN
OUR
STUDY
THIS
VARIABLE
CONTRIBUTES
THE
LEAST
IN
OUR
REVIEW
WE
HAVE
FOUND
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
PEERS
IS
RELATED
TO
ADHERENCE
THIS
IS
SOMEWHAT
CONTRARY
TO
THE
RESULTS
OF
BROUWER
WHO
CONCLUDED
THAT
PEER
SUPPORT
WAS
RELATED
TO
GREATER
EXPOSURE
IN
THAT
STUDY
EXPOSURE
WAS
SEEN
AS
THE
TIME
VISITORS
SPEND
ON
THE
WEBSITE
WHICH
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OUR
DEFINITION
OF
ADHERENCE
FURTHERMORE
IN
THIS
STUDY
WE
CODED
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
INTERACTION
NOT
MERELY
WHETHER
THERE
WAS
ANY
INTERACTION
OR
NOT
THIS
RESULTED
IN
OF
INTERVENTIONS
BEING
CODED
AS
YES
THERE
IS
INTERACTION
WITH
PEERS
BUT
THE
FREQUENCY
IS
UNKNOWN
THIS
FREQUENCY
MAY
VARY
TO
A
LARGE
DEGREE
BETWEEN
THESE
INTERVENTIONS
BUT
WITHOUT
CLEAR
INFORMATION
WE
CANNOT
MAKE
A
DISTINCTION
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
INFLUENCED
OUR
RESULTS
IN
THE
FINAL
MODEL
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
SEEMS
TO
NEGATIVELY
INFLUENCE
ADHERENCE
ALTHOUGH
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
THIS
SURPRISING
FINDING
MAY
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
MORE
INTERACTION
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
MEANT
IN
MANY
CASES
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
INTERACTION
WITH
A
COUNSELOR
MORE
FREQUENT
INTENDED
USAGE
ALSO
PREDICTS
BETTER
ADHERENCE
THIS
MIGHT
SEEM
COUNTERINTUITIVE
BUT
MIGHT
ALSO
MEAN
THAT
WHEN
PEOPLE
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
BE
MORE
ACTIVE
THEY
BECOME
MORE
ENGAGED
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
MOREOVER
MORE
FREQUENT
INTENDED
USAGE
WILL
IN
MANY
CASES
LEAD
TO
MORE
FREQUENT

AND
WE
KNOW
THAT

CAN
POSITIVELY
INFLUENCE
ADHERENCE
THAT
THE
PROVISION
OF

IS
IMPORTANT
WAS
ALSO
SEEN

AND
IS
CONFIRMED
IN
THIS

FINALLY
MORE

THIS
OUTCOME
WAS

THIS

IS
TO

THE
FIRST
TO

FINDINGS
OF

WE
HAVE
NOTED
THAT
THE

THIS
CAN
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
OBSERVING
THAT

THUS
FROM

NOT

AMONG

LIMITATIONS
THE
REVIEW
PRESENTED
IN
THIS
PAPER
HAS
TWO
MAIN
LIMITATIONS
THAT
ARE
IMPORTANT
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THE
FIRST
LIMITATION
IS
THAT
THE
REVIEW
IS
LARGELY
BASED
ON
RESEARCH
LITERATURE
FROM
HEALTH
SCIENCES
AND
HUMAN
COMPUTER
INTERACTION
AND
DOES
NOT
SURVEY
THE
MANY
COMMERCIAL
MOBILE
PHONE
HEALTH
INTERVENTIONS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
IN
RECENT
YEARS
ONE
REASON
FOR
THIS
CHOICE
IS
THAT
UNLIKE
FOR
RESEARCH
LITERATURE
THERE
IS
NO
SYSTEMATIC
WAY
TO
GET
A
COMPRE
HENSIVE
OVERVIEW
OF
COMMERCIAL
PRODUCTS
THE
OTHER
REASON
HOW
EVER
IS
THAT
OUR
GOAL
WAS
TO
PROVIDE
AN
OVERVIEW
OF
THE
DESIGN
SPACE
OF
PHONE
BASED
INTERVENTION
AND
THAT
IN
THE
COMMERCIAL
PRODUCTS
WE
FOUND
WE
DID
NOT
IDENTIFY
ANY
INTERVENTION
STRATEGIES
THAT
WERE
NOT
ALSO
REPRESENTED
IN
THE
RESEARCH
LITERATURE
OF
COURSE
GIVEN
THE
SHEER
NUMBER
OF
COMMERCIAL
SYSTEMS
IN
THIS
AREA
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
POSSIBLE
THAT
WE
OVERLOOKED
PRODUCTS
THAT
BREAK
NEW
GROUND
IN
SPITE
OF
OUR
EFFORTS
TO
BE
COMPREHENSIVE
THE
OTHER
LIMITATION
IS
THAT
THE
LARGE
MAJORITY
OF
SYSTEMS
WE
RE
VIEWED
HERE
ARE
INTENDED
TO
BE
USED
BY
PATIENTS
OR
OTHER
INDIVID
UALS
WHO
ARE
WORKING
ON
THEIR
OWN
HEALTH
GOALS
WE
DID
NOT
REVIEW
PHONE
BASED
SYSTEMS
THAT
HELP
INDIVIDUALS
TO
MANAGE
THE
HEALTH
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON
SUCH
AS
A
CHILD
OR
AN
ELDERLY
FAMILY
MEM
BER
THERE
IS
EXCITING
NEW
WORK
IN
THIS
AREA
E
G
WHICH
IS
LIKELY
TO
LEAD

THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
NOVEL
INTERVENTION
STRATEGIES
WHICH
ARE
CURRENTLY
NOT
USED
IN

BASED
INTERVENTIONS
FOR
PATIENTS
THEMSELVES
WE
SUSPECT
THAT
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THOSE
NEW
STRATEGIES
WILL
BE
APPLICABLE
TO
PERSONAL
HEALTH
APPLICATIONS
AS
WELL
FURTHER
CONTRIBUTING
TO
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HOW
TO

BECAUSE

UNDERGOING
TWO

FIRST
THERE
IS
A
GROWING
AWARENESS
OF
THE
COMPUTATIONAL
NATURE

WE
NOW
PRESENT
THREE
ARGUMENTS
IN
FAVOR
OF
USING
AND
ADAPT
ING
SOFTWARE
FROM
OTHER
PROJECTS
RATHER
THAN
RE
IMPLEMENTING
OR
REINVENTING
FUNCTIONALITY
THE
FIRST
ARGUMENT
THAT
WE
CON
SIDER
IS
THAT
WRITING
GOOD
SOFTWARE
IS
A
CHALLENGING
PROBLEM
AND
ANY
RE
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
EXISTING
ALGORITHMS
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
IF
POSSIBLE
STANDARD
TOOLS
AND
PARADIGMS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PROVEN
AND
ARE
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
SHOULD
BE
PREFERRED
OVER
NEW
UNTESTED
APPROACHES
ALL
SOFTWARE
CONTAINS
BUGS
BUT
WELL
USED
AND
MAINTAINED
SOFTWARE
TENDS
TO
CONTAIN
FEWER
THE
SECOND
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
CBB
IS
AN
ENORMOUS
FIELD
AND
THAT
PROGRESS
WILL
REQUIRE
THE
COORDINATED
EFFORTS
OF
MANY
PROJECTS
AND
SOFTWARE
DEVELOPERS
THUS
WE
WILL
REQUIRE
STRUC
TURED
PARADIGMS
FOR
ACCESSING
DATA
AND
ALGORITHMS
WRITTEN
IN
OTHER
LANGUAGES
AND
SYSTEMS
THE
MORE
STRUCTURED
AND
INTE
GRATED
THIS
FUNCTIONALITY
THE
EASIER
IT
WILL
BE
TO
USE
AND
HENCE
THE
MORE
IT
WILL
BE
USED
AS
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
WE
CONSIDER
OUR
RECENT
DEVELOPMENT
OF
TOOLS
FOR
WORKING
WITH
GRAPH
OR
NET
WORK
STRUCTURES
THERE
ARE
THREE
MAIN
PACKAGES
IN
BIOCON
DUCTOR
OF
INTERACTING
WITH
GRAPHS
THEY
ARE
GRAPH
RBGL
AND
RGRAPHVIZ
THE
FIRST
OF
THESE
PROVIDES
THE
CLASS
DESCRIPTIONS
AND
BASIC
INFRASTRUCTURE
FOR
DEALING
WITH
GRAPHS
IN
R
THE
SEC
OND
PROVIDES
ACCESS
TO
ALGORITHMS
ON
GRAPHS
AND
THE
THIRD
TO
A
RICH
COLLECTION
OF
GRAPH
LAYOUT
ALGORITHMS
THE
GRAPH
PACK
AGE
WAS
WRITTEN
FROM
SCRATCH
FOR
THIS
PROJECT
BUT
THE
OTHER
TWO
ARE
INTERFACES
TO
RICH
LIBRARIES
OF
SOFTWARE
ROUTINES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
CREATED
BY
OTHER
SOFTWARE
PROJECTS
BOOST
AND
GRAPHVIZ
RESPECTIVELY
BOTH
OF
WHICH
ARE
VERY
SUB
STANTIAL
PROJECTS
WITH
LARGE
CODE
BASES
WE
HAVE
NO
INTEREST
IN
REPLICATING
THAT
WORK
AND
WILL
WHEREVER
POSSIBLE
SIMPLY
ACCESS
THE
FUNCTIONS
AND
LIBRARIES
PRODUCED
BY
OTHER
PROJECTS
THERE
ARE
MANY
BENEFITS
FROM
THIS
APPROACH
FOR
US
AND
FOR
THE
OTHER
PROJECTS
FOR
BIOINFORMATICS
AND
COMPUTATIONAL
BIOLOGY
WE
GAIN
RAPID
ACCESS
TO
A
VARIETY
OF
GRAPH
ALGORITHMS

ING

GAIN
A
NEW
USER
BASE
AND
A
NEW
SET
OF
PROBLEMS
THAT
THEY
CAN
CONSIDER
GAINING
A
NEW
USER
BASE
IS
OFTEN
VERY
USEFUL
AS
NEW
USERS
WITH
PREVIOUSLY
UNANTICIPATED
NEEDS
TEND
TO
EXPOSE
WEAKNESSES
IN
DESIGN
AND
IMPLEMENTATION
THAT
MORE
SOPHISTICATED
OR
EXPERIENCED
USERS
ARE
OFTEN
ABLE
TO
AVOID
IN
A
SIMILAR
VEIN
WE
PLAN
TO
DEVELOP
AND
ENCOURAGE
COLLABO
RATION
WITH
OTHER
PROJECTS
INCLUDING
THOSE
ORGANIZED
THROUGH
THE
OPEN
BIOINFORMATICS
FOUNDATION
AND
THE
INTERNATIONAL
INTEROPERABILITY
CONSORTIUM
WE
HAVE
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
CON
CENTRATED
ON
COLLABORATION
TO
THIS
POINT
IN
PART
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
CHOSEN
AREAS
FOR
DEVELOPMENT
THAT
DO
NOT
OVERLAP
SIGNIF
ICANTLY
WITH
THE
TOOLS
PROVIDED
BY
THOSE
PROJECTS
IN
THIS
CASE
OUR
PHILOSOPHY
REMAINS
ONE
OF
DEVELOPING
INTERFACES
TO
THE
SOFTWARE
PROVIDED
BY
THOSE
PROJECTS
AND
NOT
RE
IMPLEMENTING
THEIR
WORK
IN
SOME
CASES
OTHER
PROJECTS
HAVE
RECOGNIZED
THE
POTENTIAL
GAINS
FOR
COLLABORATION
AND
HAVE
STARTED
DEVELOPING
INTERFACES
FOR
US
TO
THEIR
SYSTEMS
WITH
THE
INTENT
OF
MAKING
FUTURE
CONTRIBUTIONS
ANOTHER
ARGUMENT
IN
FAVOR
OF
STANDARDIZATION
AND
REUSE
OF
EXISTING
TOOLS
IS
BEST
MADE
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
A
SPECIFIC
EXAM
PLE
CONSIDER
THE
TOPIC
OF
MARKUP
AND
MARKUP
LANGUAGES
FOR
ANY
SPECIFIC
PROBLEM
ONE
COULD
QUICKLY
DEVISE
A
MARKUP
THAT
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THAT
PROBLEM
SO
WHY
THEN
SHOULD
WE
ADOPT
A
STANDARD
SUCH
AS
XML
AMONG
THE
REASONS
FOR
THIS
CHOICE
IS
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
PROGRAMMERS
CONVERSANT
WITH
THE
PARA
DIGM
AND
HENCE
LOWER
TRAINING
COSTS
A
SECOND
REASON
IS
THAT
THE
XML
COMMUNITY
IS
GROWING
AND
DEVELOPING
AND
WE
WILL
GET
SUBSTANTIAL
TECHNOLOGICAL
IMPROVEMENTS
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
INITIATE
THEM
THIS
IS
NOT
UNUSUAL
OTHER
AREAS
OF
COMPUTA
TIONAL
RESEARCH
ARE
AS
VIBRANT
AS
CBB
AND
BY
COORDINATING
AND
SHARING
IDEAS
AND
INNOVATIONS
WE
SIMPLIFY
OUR
OWN
TASKS
WHILE
PROVIDING

THESE
OTHER

MODERN

A
SLIGHTLY

OR

PUBLICA
TION
WE
RELEASE
SOFTWARE
UNDER
AN
OPEN

AS
OUR
MAIN
METHOD
OF

WE
DO
THIS
IN
THE
HOPE
THAT
IT
WILL
ENCOURAGE
REPRODUCIBILITY
EXTENSION
AND
GENERAL
ADHERENCE
TO
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
THIS
DECISION
ALSO
ENSURES
THAT
THE

IS
OPEN
TO

AND

THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
REASONS
FOR
DECIDING
TO
RELEASE
SOFTWARE
UNDER
AN
OPEN

SOME
OF
WHICH
ARE
LISTED
IN
TABLE
ANOTHER
CONSIDERATION
THAT
AROSE
WHEN
DETERMINING
THE
FORM
OF

WAS
THE
NEED
TO
ALLOW
AN
EVOLUTIONARY
ASPECT
TO
OUR
OWN
SOFTWARE
THERE
ARE
MANY
REASONS
FOR
ADOPTING
A
STRATEGY
THAT
WOULD
PERMIT
US
TO
EXTEND
AND
IMPROVE
OUR
SOFT
WARE
OFFERINGS
OVER
TIME
THE
FIELD
OF
CBB
IS
RELATIVELY
VOLATILE
AND
AS
NEW

ARE
DEVELOPED
NEW
SOFTWARE
AND
INFERENTIAL

ARE
NEEDED
FURTHER
SOFTWARE
TECHNOLOGY
ITSELF
IS
EVOLVING
THUS
WE
WANTED
TO
HAVE
A

STRAT
EGY
THAT
COULD
ACCOMMODATE
CHANGES
IN
SOFTWARE
AT
A
VARIETY
OF
LEVELS
WE
HOPE
THAT
THAT
STRATEGY
WILL
ALSO
ENCOURAGE
OUR
USERS
TO
THINK
OF
SOFTWARE
TECHNOLOGY
AS
A
DYNAMIC
FIELD
RATHER
THAN
A
STATIC
ONE
AND
TO
THEREFORE
BE
ON
THE
LOOKOUT
FOR
INNO
VATIONS
IN
THIS
ARENA
AS
WELL
AS
IN
MORE
TRADITIONAL
BIOLOGICAL
ONES
OUR
DECISION
TO
RELEASE
SOFTWARE
IN
THE
FORM
OF
R
PACKAGES
IS
AN
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THIS
CONSIDERATION
PACKAGES
ARE
EASY
TO
DISTRIBUTE
THEY
HAVE
VERSION
NUMBERS
AND
DEFINE
AN
API
A
COORDINATED
RELEASE
OF
ALL
BIOCONDUCTOR
PACKAGES
OCCURS
TWICE
EVERY
YEAR
AT
ANY
GIVEN
TIME
THERE
IS
A
RELEASE
VERSION
OF
EVERY
PACKAGE
AND
A
DEVELOPMENT
VERSION
THE
ONLY
CHANGES
ALLOWED
TO
BE
MADE
ON
THE
RELEASE
VERSION
ARE
BUG

IMPROVEMENTS
THIS
ENSURES
THAT

WILL
NOT
ENCOUNTER
RADICAL
NEW

OBTAINED
IN
THE

ALL
OTHER
CHANGES
SUCH
AS
ENHANCEMENTS
OR

CHANGES
ARE
CARRIED
OUT
ON

APPROXIMATELY
SIX
WEEKS
BEFORE

A
MAJOR
EFFORT
IS
TAKEN
TO
ENSURE
THAT
ALL

ON
THE

ARE
COORDINATED
AND
WORK
WELL
TOGETHER
DURING
THAT
PERIOD
EXTENSIVE

THROUGH

AMONGST
THE

CORE
AT

TIME
ALL

ON
THE

THAT

SIMULTANEOUSLY
A

NOTE
THAT
THESE

ARE
COMPELLING
ARGUMENTS
THAT
CAN

IN

OF
CHOOSING

WE
ARE

THE

OF

THE
OTHER
MAJOR

THE

ARE

ABOUT

DEPENDS
ON
THE
PERSPECTIVE
OF
THE

METADATA
FOR
ONE
INVESTI
GATOR
MAY
WELL
BE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
FOR
ANOTHER
THERE
ARE
TWO
MAJOR
CHALLENGES
THAT
WE
WILL
CONSIDER
FIRST
IS
THE
EVOLU
TIONARY
NATURE
OF
THE
METADATA
AS
NEW
EXPERIMENTS
ARE
DONE
AND
AS
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
BIOLOGICAL
PROCESSES
INVOLVED
INCREASES
THE
METADATA
CHANGES
AND
EVOLVES
THE
SECOND
MAJOR
PROBLEM
THAT
CONCERNS
METADATA
DATA
IS
ITS
COMPLEXITY
WE
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEVELOP
SOFTWARE
TOOLS
THAT
MAKE
IT
EASIER
FOR
DATA
ANALYSTS
AND
RESEARCHERS
TO
USE
THE
EXISTING
METADATA
APPROPRIATELY
THE
CONSTANT
CHANGING
AND
UPDATING
OF
THE
METADATA
SUGGESTS
THAT
WE
MUST
HAVE
A
SYSTEM
OR
A
COLLECTION
PROCESS
THAT
ENSURES
THAT
ANY
METADATA
CAN
BE
UPDATED
AND
THE
UPDATES
CAN
BE
DISTRIBUTED
USERS
OF
OUR
SYSTEM
WILL
WANT
ACCESS
TO
THE
MOST
RECENT
VERSIONS
OUR
SOLUTION
HAS
BEEN
TO
PLACE
META
DATA
INTO
R
PACKAGES
THESE
PACKAGES
ARE
BUILT
USING
A
SEMI
AUTOMATIC
PROCESS
AND
ARE
DISTRIBUTED
AND
UPDATED
USING
THE
PACKAGE
DISTRIBUTION
TOOLS
DEVELOPED
IN
THE
REPOS
TOOLS
PACKAGE
THERE
IS
A
NATURAL
WAY
TO
APPLY
VERSION
NUM
BERS
SO
USERS
CAN
DETERMINE
IF
THEIR
DATA
ARE
UP
TO
DATE
OR
IF
NECESSARY
THEY
CAN
OBTAIN
OLDER
VERSIONS
TO
VERIFY
PARTICULAR
ANALYSES
FURTHER
USERS
CAN
SYNCHRONIZE
A
VARIETY
OF
META
DATA
PACKAGES
ACCORDING
TO
A
COMMON
VERSION
OF
THE
DATA
SOURCES
THAT
THEY
WERE
CONSTRUCTED
FROM
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
ADVANTAGES
THAT
COME
FROM
AUTOMATING
THE
PROCESS
OF
BUILDING
DATA
PACKAGES
FIRST
THE
MODULES
ARE
UNIFORM
TO
AN
EXTENT
THAT
WOULD
NOT
BE
POSSIBLE
IF
THE
PACK
AGES
WERE
HUMAN
WRITTEN
THIS
MEANS
THAT
USERS
OF
THIS
TECH
NOLOGY
NEED
ONLY
BECOME
ACQUAINTED
WITH
ONE
PACKAGE
TO
BE
ACQUAINTED
WITH
ALL
SUCH
PACKAGES
SECOND
WE
CAN
CREATE
MANY
PACKAGES
VERY
QUICKLY
HENCE
THE
LABOR
SAVINGS
ARE
SUB
STANTIAL
FOR
MICROARRAY
ANALYSES
ALL
DATA
PACKAGES
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
INFORMATION
CHROMOSOMAL
LOCATION
GENE
ONTOLOGY
CATEGORIES
AND
SO
ON
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
PACKAGES
IS
THAT
EACH
REFERENCES
ONLY
THE
SPECIFIC
SET
OF
GENES
PROBES
THAT
WERE
ASSAYED
THIS
MEANS
THAT
DATA
ANA
LYSTS
CAN
EASILY
SWITCH
FROM
ONE
TYPE
OF
CHIP
TO
ANOTHER
IT
ALSO
MEANS
THAT
WE
CAN
DEVELOP
A
SINGLE
SET
OF
TOOLS
FOR
MANIPULAT
ING
THE
METADATA
AND
IMPROVEMENTS
IN
THOSE
TOOLS
ARE
AVAILA
BLE
TO
ALL
USERS
IMMEDIATELY
USERS
ARE
FREE
TO
EXTEND
DATA
PACKAGES
WITH
DATA
FROM
OTHER
POTENTIALLY
PROPRIETARY
SOURCES
TREATING
THE
DATA
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
THAT
WE
TREAT
SOFTWARE
HAS
ALSO
HAD
MANY
ADVANTAGES
ON
THE
SERVER
SIDE
WE
CAN
USE
THE
SAME
SOFTWARE
DISTRIBUTION
TOOLS
INDICATING
UPDATES
AND
IMPROVEMENTS
WITH
VERSION
NUMBERING
ON
THE
CLIENT
SIDE
THE
USER
DOES
NOT
NEED
TO
LEARN
ABOUT
THE
STORAGE
OR
INTERNAL
DETAILS
OF
THE
DATA
PACKAGES
THEY
SIMPLY
INSTALL
THEM
LIKE
OTHER
PACKAGES
AND
THEN
USE
THEM
ONE
ISSUE
THAT
OFTEN
ARISES
IS
WHETHER
ONE
SHOULD
SIMPLY
RELY
ON
ONLINE
SOURCES
FOR
METADATA
THAT
IS
GIVEN
AN
IDENTIFIER
THE
USER
CAN
POTENTIALLY
OBTAIN
MORE
UP
TO
DATE
INFORMATION
BY
QUERYING
THE
APPROPRIATE
DATABASES
THE
DATA
PACKAGES
WE
ARE
PROPOSING
CANNOT
BE

CURRENT
THERE
ARE
HOWEVER
SOME
DISADVANTAGES
TO
THE
APPROACH
OF
ACCESSING
ALL
RESOURCES
ONLINE
FIRST
USERS
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
ONLINE
THEY
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
AWARE
OF
ALL
APPLICABLE
INFORMATION
SOURCES
AND
THE
INVEST
MENT
IN
PERSON
TIME
TO
OBTAIN
SUCH
INFORMATION
CAN
BE
HIGH
THERE
ARE
ALSO
ISSUES
OF
REPRODUCIBILITY
THAT
ARE
INTRACTABLE
AS
THE
OWNERS
OF
THE
WEB
RESOURCES
ARE
FREE
TO
UPDATE
AND
MODIFY
THEIR
OFFERINGS
AT

SOME
BUT
NOT
ALL
OF
THESE
DIFFICULTIES
CAN
BE
ALLEVIATED
IF
THE
DATA
ARE
AVAILABLE
IN
A
WEB
SERVICES
FORMAT
ANOTHER
ARGUMENT
THAT
CAN
BE
MADE
IN
FAVOR
OF
OUR
APPROACH
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
IS
THAT
IT
ALLOWS
THE
PERSON
CONSTRUCTING
THE
DATA
PACKAGES
TO
AMALGAMATE
DISPARATE
INFORMATION
FROM
A
NUMBER
OF
SOURCES
IN
BUILDING
METADATA
PACKAGES
FOR
BIO
CONDUCTOR
WE
FIND
THAT
SOME
DATA
ARE
AVAILABLE
FROM
DIFFERENT
SOURCES
AND
UNDER
THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WE
LOOK
FOR
CONSEN
SUS
IF
POSSIBLE
THE
PROCESS
IS
QUITE
SOPHISTICATED
AND
IS
DETAILED
IN
THE
ANNBUILDER
PACKAGE
AND
PAPER
TRAINING
MOST
OF
THE
PROJECTS
IN
CBB
REQUIRE
A
COMBINATION
OF
SKILLS
FROM
BIOLOGY
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
AND
STATISTICS
BECAUSE
THE
FIELD
IS
NEW
AND
THERE
HAS
BEEN
LITTLE
SPECIALIZED
TRAINING
IN
THIS
AREA
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
SUBSTANTIAL
BENEFIT
TO
BE
HAD
FROM
PAYING
ATTENTION
TO
TRAINING
FROM
THE
PERSPECTIVE
OF
THE
BIOCONDUCTOR
PROJECT
MANY
OF
OUR
POTENTIAL
USERS
ARE
UNFAMILIAR
WITH
THE
R
LANGUAGE
AND
GENERALLY
ARE
SCIENTIFICALLY
MORE
ALIGNED
WITH
ONE
DISCIPLINE
THAN
ALL
THREE
IT
IS
THEREFORE
IMPORTANT
THAT
WE
PRODUCE
DOCUMENTATION
FOR
THE
SOFTWARE
MODULES
THAT
IS
ACCESSIBLE
TO
ALL
WE
HAVE
TAKEN
A
TWO
PRONGED
APPROACH
TO
THIS
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNTS
OF
COURSE
MATERIAL
AIMED
AT
ALL
THE
CONSTITUENT
DISCI
PLINES
AND
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
SYSTEM
FOR
INTERACTIVE
USE
OF
SOFTWARE
AND
DOCUMENTATION
IN
THE
FORM
OF
VIGNETTES
AND
MORE
GENERALLY
IN
THE
FORM
OF
NAVIGABLE
DOCUMENTS
WITH
DYNAMIC
CONTENT
COURSE

HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
AND
REFINED
OVER
THE
PAST
TWO

THREE

SEVERAL
MEMBERS
OF
THE
BIOCONDUCTOR
DEVELOPMENT
TEAM
HAVE
TAUGHT

AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
REFINED
THE

BASED
ON

AND

THE
MATERIALS
DEVELOPED
ARE
MODULAR

ARE
FREELY

BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
A
REQUIREMENT
AND
MERELY
REFLECTS
OUR
OWN
SPECIFIC
PURPOSES
AND

IN

WE
FEEL
THAT
WE
WOULD
BENEFIT
GREATLY
FROM

THERE
ARE

THAT
ARE

IN

THAT
WE
ARE
LARGELY
UNAWARE

HOWEVER
IN

WE
RELY
ON
THE

OUR

AND
THE

OF

TO

AND
WE
HOPE
THAT
MANY
WILL
CON
TRIBUTE
OTHERS
CAN
EASILY
MAKE
SUBSTANTIAL
CONTRIBUTIONS
EVEN
THOSE
WITH
LITTLE
OR
NO
PROGRAMMING
SKILLS
WHAT
IS
REQUIRED
IS
DOMAIN
KNOWLEDGE
IN
ONE
FIELD
OF
INTEREST
AND
THE
RECOGNITION
OF
A
PROBLEM
THAT
REQUIRES
ADDITIONAL
DOMAIN
KNOWLEDGE
FROM
ANOTHER
OF
THE
FIELDS
OF

OUR
EXPERIENCE
HAS
BEEN
THAT
MANY
OF
THESE
NEW

OFTEN
TRANSFORM
THEMSELVES
INTO

THUS
OUR

OF

NEEDS

SOME
ATTENTION

OF

AS

ATTRACTING

ESSENTIAL
TO

RESPONDING

THE
SUCCESS
OF
ANY

RESTS
ON
ITS
ABILITY
TO
BOTH
PROVIDE
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
PROBLEMS
IT
IS
ADDRESSING
AND
TO
ATTRACT
A

COMMUNITY
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
WAY
OF
ADDRESSING

IS
THROUGH
AN
E

HELP
LIST
AND
ONE
WAS
SET
UP
AS
SOON
AS

BECAME

IN

IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
KEEP
A

AVAILABLE
SO
THAT
THE

ITSELF
HAS
A
MEMORY
AND
NEW
USERS
CAN
BE
REFERRED
THERE
FOR
ANSWERS
TO
COMMON
QUESTIONS
IT
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
THAT
MEMBERS
OF
THE

DEAL
WITH
BUG

FEATURE

THROUGH
THIS

AS
IT

TO

TO
EXPLORE

WHETHER
IT

AN

SUFFICIENTLY

THAT

WE

IS
GENERALLY

IN

WE
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO

AT

FOR

WE
WOULD
OF

WELCOME

COLLABORATE

PROB
LEM
ONE
OF
THE

IS
THAT

THE
CRUCIAL
REQUIREMENTS
TO

THE

THAT

OF

NATOM
SET
TO
T
IF
THE
ATOM
IS
SELECTED
AND
F
IF
THE
ATOM
IS
NOT

THIS
IS
USEFUL
WHEN
ONE
NEEDS
TO
KNOW
BOTH
SELECTED
AND
UNSELECTED
ATOMS
HOWEVER
IT
IS
FAR
MORE
COMMON
TO
ONLY
BE
INTERESTED
IN
SELECTED
ATOMS
AND
SO
THE
SECOND
MASK
TYPE
IN
CPPTRAJ
IS
AN
INTEGER
ARRAY
OF

NSELECTED
WHERE
NSELECTED
IS
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
SELECTED
ATOMS
CONTAINING
ONLY
THE
ATOM
NUMBERS
OF
SELECTED
ATOMS
TYPICALLY
NSELECTED
IS
MUCH
SMALLER
THAN

SO
TO
USE
THE
PREVIOUS
EXAMPLE
OF
A

INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
TO
EXECUTE

TIMES
THE
LOOP
ONLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
EXECUTED
NSELECTED

WITH
NO
CONDITIONAL
INSIDE

THIS
ALSO
SAVES

THE
STRATEGIES
EMPLOYED
IN

ARE
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
FOR

THE
STRATEGY
WAS
TO
PARALLELIZE
TRAJECTORY
READS
I
E
DIVIDE
EACH
TRAJECTORY
AMONG
THE
NUMBER
OF
THREADS
BEING
USED
WITHIN

GIVEN
A

AND
TWO

THREAD
WOULD
READ

WHILE
THREAD
WOULD
READ
FRAMES
WHILE
THIS
DID
AT
TIMES
RESULT
IN
A
SIGNIFICANT
SPEEDUP
AND
SCALED
REASONABLY
WELL
THERE
WERE
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
THE
FIRST
WAS
THAT
AS
IMPLEMENTED
THE
NUMBER
OF
INPUT
FRAMES
WAS
REQUIRED
TO
BE
A
MULTIPLE
OF
THE
NUMBER
OF
THREADS
SO
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
READ
FRAMES
WITH
TWO
THREADS
ANOTHER
IS
THAT
THE
PERFORMANCE
HAS
PROVED
TO
BE
EXTREMELY
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
UNDERLYING
FILE
SYSTEM
FOR
SOME
STANDARD
NONPARALLEL
FILE
SYSTEMS
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
NO
SPEEDUP
OR
EVEN
A
SLOWDOWN
WHEN
USING
MULTIPLE
THREADS
FINALLY
THIS
APPROACH
ALSO
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
TRAJECTORY
BE
SEEKABLE
I
E
THE
FILE
CAN
BE
OPENED
AT
A
SPECIFIC
FRAME
AS
SUCH
ITS
USE
IS
CURRENTLY
RESTRICTED
TO
AMBER
FORMATTED

NETCDF
TRAJECTORIES
TO
AVOID
THESE
ISSUES
IT
WAS
DECIDED
THAT
FOR
CPPTRAJ
ONLY
CERTAIN
TIME
CONSUMING
ACTIONS
WOULD
BE
PARALLELIZED
USING
OPENMP
AS
IT
IS
NOW
QUITE
COMMONPLACE
FOR
EVEN

MACHINES
TO
HAVE
TWO
OR
MORE
CORES
THE
SIMPLICITY
OF
PARALLELIZING
TIME
CONSUMING
ACTIONS
WITHIN
A
SHARED

FRAMEWORK
MAKES
OPENMP
AN
ATTRACTIVE

SOLUTION
IN

CAN
BE
ACHIEVED

WITH

THIS

CALCULATING
THE

FOR

AND
RETURNING
THE

WITH
THE

THIS

IS
SPED
UP
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
BOTH
THE

THE

IN

THE

GAIN
ACHIEVED
BY
COLLATING

IS
A
RESULT
OF
THE

THAT
A
