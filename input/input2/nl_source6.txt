IF

THEN
THE

THE

THE

THE

ALL

HENCE
WE
SEE
THAT
AN
ESSEN
TIAL
CHARACTERISTIC
FOR

IS
THAT
THE

EITHER

AS
IN

THEY

IN
CONCLUSION
THERE
ARE
TWO
CANDIDATE

FOR
THE

A

AND
AS
EACH
HAS
SIMILAR
CHARACTERISTICS
SUCH

HOW
THESE

A
FORMAL
TECHNIQUE
FOR
ANALYZING

BASED

FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
CODD
THE
TECHNIQUE
INVOLVES
A
SERIES
OF
RULES
THAT
CAN
BE
USED
TO
TEST
INDIVIDUAL
RELATIONS
SO
THAT
A
DATA
BASE
CAN
BE
NORMALIZED
TO
ANY
DEGREE
WHEN
A
REQUIREMENT
IS
NOT
MET
THE
RELATION
VIOLATING
THE
REQUIREMENT
MUST
BE
DECOMPOSED

WHETHER

WE

IN

WE

IN

BY

INFERENCE
RULES
FOR

IN

WE
IDENTIFIED
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
FUNCTIONAL

THAT
ARE
MOST
USEFUL
IN

HOWEVER
EVEN
IF
WE
RESTRICT
OUR

ON

HOLD

ARE

THEN
THE

SET
OF
FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
FOR
A
GIVEN
RELATION
CAN
STILL
BE
VERY
LARGE
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
FIND
AN
APPROACH
THAT
CAN
REDUCE
THAT
SET
TO
A
MANAGEABLE
SIZE
IDEALLY
WE
WANT
TO
IDENTIFY
A
SET
OF

REPRESENTED

FOR

THAT
IS

THAN
THE

THE

THIS

SUGGESTS
THAT
THERE
MUST
BE

THAT
CAN

FOR

FUNCTIONAL

ALSO
HOLDS
IN

A
C
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
TRANSITIVE
FUNCTIONAL

AND
WAS

PREVIOUSLY
IN

AND
HOW
DO
WE
BEGIN
TO
IDENTIFY
USEFUL
FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
ON

NORMALLY
THE
DATABASE
DESIGNER
STARTS
BY
SPECIFYING
FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
THAT
ARE

OBVIOUS
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
USUALLY
NUMEROUS
OTHER
FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
IN

THE
TASK
OF
SPECIFYING
ALL
POSSIBLE
FUNCTIONAL
DEPENDENCIES
FOR
REAL
DATABASE
PROJECTS
IS
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
NOT
IMPRACTICAL
HOWEVER
IN
THIS
SECTION
WE
DO
CONSIDER
AN
APPROACH
THAT
HELPS
IDENTIFY
THE
COMPLETE
SET
OF
FUNC

DEPENDENCIES
FOR
A

AND
THEN
DISCUSS
HOW
TO

THAT

OCCASIONALLY

AS
YOU

THERE

THIS
IS

IS

THE

FOR

CONSEQUENTLY
WE
MAY
THINK
THAT
THE
RELATIONSHIP
FATHEROF
IS
UNNECESSARY
HOWEVER
THIS
WOULD
BE
INCORRECT
FOR
TWO
REASONS
THE
FATHER
MAY
HAVE
CHILDREN
FROM
A
PREVIOUS
MARRIAGE
AND
WE
ARE
MODELING
ONLY
THE
FATHER
CURRENT
MARRIAGE
THROUGH
A

THE

MAY

THE
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
EXAMINE
THE
MEANING
OF
EACH
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
ENTITIES
WHEN
ASSESSING
REDUNDANCY
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
STEP
WE
HAVE
SIMPLIFIED
THE

BY
REMOVING
ANY

THAT
THE

A
NONREDUNDANT
RELATIONSHIP
FATHEROF
WE
NOW
HAVE
A
CONCEPTUAL

MODEL
THAT
REPRESENTS
THE

REQUIREMENTS
OF

THE
OBJECTIVE
OF
THIS
STEP
IS
TO
CHECK
THE
MODEL
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
MODEL
SUPPORTS
THE
REQUIRED
TRANSACTIONS
USING
THE
MODEL
WE
ATTEMPT
TO
PERFORM
THE
OPERATIONS
MANUALLY
IF
WE
CAN
RESOLVE
ALL
TRANSACTIONS
IN
THIS
WAY
WE
HAVE
CHECKED
THAT
THE
CONCEPTUAL

MODEL
SUPPORTS
THE
REQUIRED
TRANSACTIONS
HOWEVER
IF
WE
ARE
UNABLE
TO
PERFORM
A

MANUALLY
THERE
MUST
BE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE

MODEL
WHICH
MUST
BE
RESOLVED
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
IS
LIKELY
THAT
WE
HAVE
OMITTED
AN
ENTITY
A
RELATIONSHIP
OR
AN
ATTRIBUTE
FROM
THE

WE
EXAMINE
TWO
POSSIBLE
APPROACHES
TO
ENSURING
THAT
THE

SUPPORTS
THE
REQUIRED

DESCRIBING
THE

USING
THE
FIRST
APPROACH
WE
CHECK
THAT

REQUIRED
BY

IS
PROVIDED
BY

BY

THIS

BECOME
SO
FOR
READABILITY
WE
MAY
NEED
SEVERAL
SUCH
DIAGRAMS
TO
COVER
ALL
THE

THIS
APPROACH
ALLOWS
THE
DESIGNER
TO
VISUALIZE
AREAS
OF
THE
MODEL
THAT
ARE
NOT
REQUIRED
BY
TRANSACTIONS
AND
THOSE
AREAS
THAT
ARE
CRITICAL
TO

WE
ARE
THEREFORE
IN
A
POSITION
TO
DIRECTLY
REVIEW
THE
SUPPORT
PROVIDED
BY
THE

FOR
THE

REQUIRED
IF
THERE
ARE
AREAS
OF
THE

THAT
DO
NOT
APPEAR
TO
BE
USED
BY
ANY

WE
MAY
QUESTION
THE
PURPOSE
OF
REPRESENTING
THIS
INFORMATION
IN
THE

ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
THERE
ARE
AREAS
OF
THE
MODEL
THAT
ARE
INADEQUATE
IN
PROVIDING
THE
CORRECT
PATHWAY
FOR
A

WE
MAY
NEED
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
CRITICAL
ENTITIES
RELATIONSHIPS
OR
ATTRIBUTES
HAVE
BEEN
MISSED
IT
MAY
LOOK
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
HARD
WORK
TO
CHECK
EVERY
TRANSACTION
THAT
THE
MODEL
HAS
TO
SUPPORT
IN
THIS
WAY
AND
IT
CERTAINLY
CAN
BE
AS
A
RESULT
IT
MAY
BE
TEMPTING
TO
OMIT
THIS
STEP
HOWEVER
IT
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
THAT
THESE

ARE
PERFORMED
NOW

WHETHER
THE

SUPPORTS
THE

AND
NORMALIZATION
IS
A
TECHNIQUE
FOR

WHICH
ATTRIBUTES

TOGETHER
IN
A

ONE
OF
THE
BASIC
AIMS
OF
RELATIONAL

DESIGN
IS
TO
GROUP
ATTRIBUTES
TOGETHER
IN
A
RELATION
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
FUNC

THE
RESULT
OF
NORMALIZATION
IS
A

THAT
IS
STRUCTURALLY
CONSISTENT

HAS
MINIMAL
REDUNDANCY
HOWEVER
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
ARGUED
THAT

DOES

CONSEQUENTLY
THERE
MAY

CIRCUMSTANCES
IN

THE

OF

THAT

THE

DENORMALIZATION
MAY

FORMALLY
THE

DENORMALIZATION
REFERS
TO
A
REFINEMENT
TO
THE
RELATIONAL

SUCH
THAT
THE
DEGREE
OF

FOR
A

IS
LESS

GENERAL

IF

WE

WHENEVER

IT
IS

THE

THAT

FOR

IF

IT

FOR

THE

BOTH
APPEAR
TWICE

IT
BECOMES

OF
MULTIPLE
COPIES
IF
THE
UPDATE
OF
THE
INAME
ATTRIBUTE
IN
THE
PRIVATEOWNER
AND
PROPERTYFORRENT
RELATION
CANNOT
BE
AUTOMATED
THE
POTENTIAL
FOR
LOSS
OF

IS
CONSIDERABLE
AN
ASSOCIATED
PROBLEM
WITH

IS
THE
ADDITIONAL

THAT
IS
REQUIRED
TO

TAIN
CONSISTENCY
AUTOMATICALLY
EVERY
TIME
A

UPDATED
OR

IN
OUR
CASE
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
NAME
OF
THE
OWNER
OF
A
PROPERTY
WILL
CHANGE
SO
THE
DUPLICATION
MAY
BE
WARRANTED
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
TO
CONSIDER
IS
THE
INCREASE
IN
STORAGE
SPACE
RESULTING
FROM
THE
DUPLICATION
AGAIN
WITH
THE
RELATIVELY
LOW
COST
OF
SECONDARY
STORAGE
NOWADAYS
THIS
MAY
NOT
BE
SO
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
NOT
A
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
ARBITRARY

A
SPECIAL

OF
A
ONE

ONE
OTHER

HOWEVER
THE
INCREASING

WE
ADDRESS
SOME
OF
THE
ISSUES
ASSOCIATED
WITH

IN
THESE
ENVIRONMENTS
PROXY
SERVERS
IN
A
WEB
ENVIRONMENT
A
PROXY
SERVER
IS
A
COMPUTER
THAT
SITS
BETWEEN
A
WEB
BROWSER
AND
A
WEB
SERVER
IT
INTERCEPTS
ALL
REQUESTS
TO
THE
WEB
SERVER
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
IT
CAN
FULFILL
THE
REQUESTS
ITSELF
IF
NOT
IT
FORWARDS
THE
REQUESTS
TO
THE
WEB
SERVER
PROXY
SERVERS
HAVE
TWO
MAIN
PURPOSES
TO
IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE
AND
FILTER
REQUESTS
IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE
BECAUSE
A
PROXY
SERVER
SAVES
THE
RESULTS
OF
ALL
REQUESTS
FOR
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
IT
CAN
SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE
FOR
GROUPS
OF
USERS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ASSUME
THAT
USER
A
AND
USER
B
ACCESS
THE
WEB
THROUGH
A
PROXY
SERVER
FIRST
USER
A
REQUESTS
A
CERTAIN
WEB
PAGE
AND
SLIGHTLY
LATER
USER
B
REQUESTS
THE
SAME
PAGE
INSTEAD
OF
FORWARDING
THE
REQUEST
TO
THE
WEB
SERVER
WHERE
THAT
PAGE
RESIDES
THE
PROXY
SERVER
SIMPLY
RETURNS
THE
CACHED
PAGE
THAT
IT
HAD
ALREADY
FETCHED
FOR
USER
A
BECAUSE
THE
PROXY
SERVER
IS
OFTEN
ON
THE
SAME
NETWORK
AS
THE

THIS
IS
A
MUCH
FASTER
OPERATION
REAL
PROXY
SERVERS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
EMPLOYED
BY
COMPUSERVE

ONLINE
CAN
SUPPORT
THOUSANDS
OF

FILTER
REQUESTS
PROXY
SERVERS
CAN
ALSO
BE
USED
TO
FILTER
REQUESTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
AN
ORGANIZATION
MIGHT
USE
A
PROXY
SERVER
TO
PREVENT
ITS
EMPLOYEES
FROM
ACCESSING
A
SPECIFIC
SET
OF
WEB
SITES
FIREWALLS
THE
STANDARD
SECURITY
ADVICE
IS
TO
ENSURE
THAT
WEB
SERVERS
ARE
UNCONNECTED
TO
ANY
IN
HOUSE
NETWORKS
AND
REGULARLY
BACKED
UP
TO
RECOVER
FROM
INEVITABLE
ATTACKS
WHEN
THE
WEB
SERVER
MUST
BE
CONNECTED

AN
INTERNAL

CORRECTLY
A
FIREWALL

A
SYSTEM
DESIGNED
TO

FIREWALLS

BE

AS
BOTH
HARDWARE

A
COMBINATION
OF
BOTH
THEY
ARE
FREQUENTLY

ANOTHER
POINT
OF
CONFUSION
MAY
BE
THE
CONTRAST
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS

WHAT
IS

WE
MAY
THINK
OF
LAWS
AS
SIMPLY
ENFORCING
CERTAIN

BEHAVIORS
FOR

PLE
MOST
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
UNETHICAL
TO
STEAL
FROM

ENOUGH
INDIVIDUALS
SEEM
CAPABLE
OF
DISMISSING
THIS
ASPECT
OF
DOING
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
THAT
IN
MOST
SOCIETIES
LAWS
MUST
BE
ENACTED
TO
ENFORCE
THIS
PARTICULAR
ETHICAL
BEHAVIOR
THIS
LINE
OF
THINK
ING
LEADS
TO
TWO
FAMILIAR
IDEAS
WHAT
IS
ETHICAL
IS
LEGAL
AND
WHAT
IS
UNETHICAL
IS
ILLEGAL
MANY
EXAMPLES
CAN
BE
PROVIDED
TO

THESE
CLAIMS
THIS

THE

IN

WE
COMPARE

WE
COMPARE
THE

TO

THAT
THE

PERFORMS
WORSE

THE

SOMETIMES
REVEALS
NEGATIVE

IN

WHILE
THE
RANDOMLY

EXHIBITS
VERY
HIGH
POSITIVE

WITH

WE

IN

WITH
THE
RANDOMLY

OVER

BOTH
OF

SURPRISINGLY
WE
FIND
THAT

ALMOST

WE
ATTRIBUTE

ALTHOUGH
THE

VERY

IN

WE

FROM

EVEN
WITH

WE
SEE
A

OVERALL
WE
FIND
THAT
THE

DEPEND
STRONGLY
ON
THE

AND
THE
TYPE
OF

THAT
THE

LEADS
TO
THE
NEXT

CONCERNING
THE

WE
ACTUALLY

WE
SUGGEST
THAT
WE
FOUND

THAT
CAN

ABSTRACT
THE
PROMISE
OF

DRIVEN
DECISION
MAKING
IS
NOW
BEING
RECOG
NIZED
BROADLY
AND
THERE
IS
GROWING
ENTHUSIASM
FOR
THE
NOTION
OF
BIG

INCLUDING
THE
RECENT
ANNOUNCEMENT
FROM
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
ABOUT
NEW
FUNDING
INITIATIVES
ACROSS
DIFFERENT
AGENCIES
THAT
TARGET
RESEARCH
FOR
BIG
DATA
WHILE
THE
PROMISE
OF
BIG

IS
REAL
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
IS
ESTIMATED
THAT
GOOGLE
ALONE
CONTRIBUTED
BILLION
DOLLARS
TO
THE
US
ECONOMY
IN
THERE
IS
NO
CLEAR
CONSENSUS
ON
WHAT
IS
BIG
DATA
IN
FACT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
CONTROVERSIAL
STATE
MENTS
ABOUT
BIG
DATA
SUCH
AS
SIZE
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
MATTERS
IN
THIS
PANEL
WE
WILL
TRY
TO
EXPLORE
THE
CONTROVERSIES
AND
DEBUNK
THE
MYTHS
SURROUNDING
BIG
DATA
INTRODUCTION
IT
IS
HARD
TO
AVOID
MENTION
OF
BIG
DATA
ANYWHERE
WE
TURN
TO
DAY
THERE
IS
BROAD
RECOGNITION
OF
THE
VALUE
OF

AND

OBTAINED
THROUGH
ANALYZING
IT
POPULAR
NEWS

NOW
AP
PRECIATES
THE

WITH
THE

OF

GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
HAVE
RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED
SIGNIFICANT
PRO
GRAMS
TOWARDS
ADDRESSING
CHALLENGES
OF
BIG
YET
MANY
HAVE
A
VERY
NARROW
INTERPRETATION
OF
WHAT
THAT
MEANS
AND
WE
LOSE
TRACK
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
MULTIPLE
STEPS
TO
THE
DATA
ANALYSIS
PIPELINE
WHETHER
THE
DATA
ARE
BIG
OR
SMALL
AT
EACH
STEP
THERE
IS
WORK
TO
BE
DONE
AND
THERE
ARE
CHALLENGES
WITH
BIG
DATA
THE
FIRST
STEP
IS
DATA
ACQUISITION
SOME
DATA
SOURCES
SUCH
AS
SEN
SOR
NETWORKS
CAN
PRODUCE
STAGGERING
AMOUNTS
OF
RAW
DATA
MUCH
OF
THIS
DATA
IS
OF
NO
INTEREST
AND
IT
CAN
BE
FILTERED
AND
COMPRESSED
BY
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
ONE
CHALLENGE
IS
TO
DEFINE
THESE
FILTERS
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
DISCARD
USEFUL
INFORMATION
FOR
EXAM
PLE
IN
CONSIDERING
NEWS
REPORTS
IS
IT
ENOUGH
TO
RETAIN
ONLY
THOSE
THAT
MENTION
THE

OF
A
COMPANY
OF

DO
WE
NEED
THE
FULL

OR
JUST
A

OND
BIG

BIG

TO

WHAT

HOW
IT

AND
MEA
SURED
THIS
METADATA
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
CRUCIAL
TO

FOR

WE
MAY
NEED
TO

THE

IF
WE
WISH
TO
EXAMINE
DUPLICATES
FREQUENTLY
THE
INFORMATION
COLLECTED
WILL
NOT
BE
IN
A
FORMAT
READY
FOR

THE
SECOND
STEP
IS
AN
INFORMATION
EXTRACTION
PROCESS
THAT
PULLS
OUT
THE
REQUIRED
INFORMATION
FROM
THE
UNDERLYING
SOURCES
AND
EXPRESSES
IT
IN
A
STRUCTURED
FORM
SUITABLE
FOR

A
NEWS
REPORT
WILL
GET
REDUCED
TO
A
CONCRETE
STRUCTURE
SUCH
AS
A
SET
OF

OR
EVEN
A
SINGLE

TO
FACILITATE

FUR
THERMORE
WE
ARE
USED
TO
THINKING
OF
BIG

AS
ALWAYS
TELLING
US
THE
TRUTH
BUT
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
FAR
FROM
REALITY
WE
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
ERRONEOUS
DATA
SOME
NEWS

ARE
INACCURATE
DATA

IS
CONSIDERABLY
MORE
CHALLENGING
THAN
SIMPLY
LO
CATING

FOR

ANALYSIS
ALL
OF
THIS
HAS
TO

THIS

THE

THEREFORE
NO

A
MAJOR
DRAWBACK
OF

IS
THAT

HAVE
A

RATHER
THAN
EMPLOYING

SIMILAR

ANOTHER
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THAT
THE
SORTING
OF

SENSITIVE
TOWARD
ERRORS
AND
VARIATIONS
IN
THE

EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
VERY

THIS
DRAWBACK

BE
OVERCOME

SIMILARLY

SECOND
DISADVANTAGE

THEREFORE
GOOD

RECENT

THE

IMPROVED
THE

SET

THE
CHARACTERISTICS

USED

THE
IDEA
IS

THEREFORE
BE
SEEN
AS
A
COMBINATION
OF

THE
ADAPTIVE
NATURE

IS
TO

IF

WE

FIRST

A

SINCE

THIS

A
MAJOR

IN

AND
WHILE

IN

IT

ALTHOUGH

CITATIONS

ALSO
GIVEN

THIS
IS

A

OF

IT

THE

A

FROM
THIS
RESEARCH
THE
THEORETICAL
FOUNDATIONS
FOR
THIS
STUDY
ARE
DRAWN
FROM
COMMUNICATION
MANAGEMENT
AND
THE
SOCIAL
SCIENCES
IN
GENERAL
BECAUSE
THE
ONLINE
PRESENCE
OF
A
COMPANY
PROVIDES
STAKEHOLDERS
WITH
ACCESS
TO
ESSENTIAL
CORPORATE
INFORMATION
AND
THANKS
TO
THE
NEW

PROVIDES
THE
POSSIBILITY

SYMMETRICAL

SYMMETRICAL

SUGGESTED
THAT

BOTH

OF

THE
DESIRE

IN
PARTICULAR
JOURNALISTS
AS
STAKEHOLDERS
EXPECT
THIS
FUNCTIONALITY
FROM

AND
REBER
JOURNALISTS
ITERATE
THAT
A
POOR
WEB
PRESENCE
CAN
REDUCE
THE
PRESS

OF
A
COMPANY
NIELSEN
SO
COMPANIES
NEED
TO
KEEP
UP
WITH
DEVELOPING
TECHNOLOGY
PETTIGREW
AND
REBER
AND
INTEGRATE
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
AND
THESE
TOOLS
INTO
THEIR
COMMUNICATION
STRATEGY
ROPER
ARGUED
THAT
SYMMETRICAL
COMMUNICATION
CAN
LEAD
TO
GREATER
POWER
FOR
THE
ORGANISATION
THAN
ASYMMETRICAL
COMMUNICATION
ACCORDING
TO
HABERMAS
A
DIALOGUE
CANNOT
BE
DOMINATED
BY
ONE
SIDE
AND
IT
SHOULD
BE
COOPERATIVE
AND
COMMUNICATIVE
AS
PETTIGREW
AND
REBER
STATED
ONE
OF
THE
FEATURES
OF
A
DIALOGIC
ACT
IS
ITS
POWER
IN
THIS
WORK
THE
FOUCAULDIAN
APPROACH
IS
USED
WHICH
CAN
BE
DESCRIBED
AS
POWER
WHICH
EXISTS
IN
A
NETWORK
OF
RELATIONSHIPS
RATHER
THAN
THE
KIND
OF
POWER
THAT
INFLUENCES
FROM
THE
TOP
DOWN
SO
IT
CAN
BE
UNDERSTOOD
AS
A
REJECTION
OF
COMMON
POWER
CONCEPTS
ACCORDING
TO
FOUCAULT
THE
POWER
IS
NOT
MONOPOLISED
WHICH
COULD
ONLY
HAVE
A
NEGATIVE
ASPECT
BECAUSE
THE
POWER
CAN
EXCLUDE
DIALOGUES
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
CAN
ALSO
CREATE
THEM
THIS
MECHANISM
RAISES
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
RESISTANCE
THE
A
SET
OF
METRICS
OIR
QUESTION
NATURALLY
ARISES
OF
HOW
TO
CREATE
CONDITIONS
FOR

WE
SUGGEST
THAT

CAN
BE

SOLUTION
DIALOGIC
THEORY
SUGGESTS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE

THAT
IS
IMPORTANT
WITHIN

BUT
THE

CONCLUSION
WE
BEGAN
THIS
WORK
AS
A

AFTER

THE
LACK

AND
THE
OVERLAP
BETWEEN

DURING

IT
BECAME
CLEAR
TO
US
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
DESIGN
THE
METRICS
IN
A
WAY
THAT
MAKES
THEM
SUITABLE
FOR
EVERYONE
WHO
IS
INTERESTED
IN
ONLINE
CORPORATE
COMMUNICATION
AND
REPUTATION
OUR
MOST
IMPORTANT
CONTRIBUTION
IS
PROPOSING
THE
SET
OF
VALIDATED
METRICS
BASED
ON
THEORIES
WHICH
ALSO
CAN
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THEORY
VALIDATION
AND
INTERPRETATION
IN
THIS
RESEARCH
PAPER
FOUR
RESEARCH
QUESTIONS
WERE
ADDRESSED
AND
ANSWERED
SEE
TABLE

BASED
ON
THEORIES
THE
PROPOSED
METRICS
WERE
ABLE
TO

REACTIVITY

THEIR
ENGAGEMENT
THE
MOOD
OF
STAKEHOLDERS
AND
THE

FROM
THE
COMPANY
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ASSESSING
SOCIAL
LEGITIMACY
BY
MEANS
OF
VOLUNTARY
CSR
DISCLOSURE
ON

ALL
THE
PROPOSED
METRICS
COULD
BE
ADAPTED
FOR

NECESSARY

IN

THE
EQUIVALENT

BUT
APART
FROM
THAT
THE
OTHER
METRIC

ARE

THE
QUANTITATIVE
INFORMATION
SHOWS
THAT
THE

ARE
MORE
LIKED
PER

THAN

OR
SHARED
PER

FUTURE
RESEARCH
IS
NEEDED
TO
SEE
WHY
THIS
IS

THE
REASON
MAY
BE
THE
DIFFICULTY
IN
ENCOURAGING
THE

OF

STAKEHOLDER

ALTHOUGH
THOSE
STAKEHOLDERS
WHO
GAVE
SOME

BY

HAVE

AN

IT

TO

ON
THE

BUTTON
THAN
TO
PUT
THEIR

AND

THE

THAT

NOT
SEEM

THE

SHOWS
THAT

COMPRISES
THE
BIGGEST
PART
BUT

A

PROPOSED

HOWEVER
WE
DEEM
IT

AN
AFTERTHOUGHT
WITH
THE

IN

WITHOUT
ADEQUATELY

WHICH

ANOTHER
PROBLEM
WITH

IS
THAT
THEY
ARE

TO

RULES
RELATED

A

THE

MAY

THE
UNDERLYING
WSN
OUR
SOLUTION
IS
BASED
ON
THE
FOLLOWING
OBSERVATIONS
FIRST
THE
CONTROL
TRAFFIC
IS
MAINLY
COMPRISED
OF
TWO
TYPES
OF
CONTROL
MESSAGES
PACKET
IN
AND
PACKET
OUT
OR
FLOW
MOD
A
PACKET
IN
IS
A
FLOW
SETUP
REQUEST
SENT
BY
A
SENSOR
TO
A
CONTROLLER
TO
SEEK
INSTRUCTION
ON
HOW
TO
HANDLE
AN
INCOMING
PACKET
UPON
TABLE
MISS
A
PACKET
DOES
NOT
MATCH
ANY
FLOW
ENTRY
A
PACKET
OUT
OR
FLOW
MOD
IS
THE
RESPONSE
FROM
THE
CONTROLLER
GIVING
INSTRUCTION
TO
THE
REQUESTING
SENSOR
SECOND
THE
CONTROL
TRAFFIC
RESULTING
FROM
THIS
CAN
BE
SIG
NIFICANT
BECAUSE
WSN
TRAFFIC
IS
OFTEN
BURSTY
AN
EVENT
OF
INTEREST
CAN
TRIGGER
A
LARGE
SWARM
OF
PACKETS
FROM
SEVERAL
SENSORS
LEADING
TO
MANY
FLOW
SETUP
REQUESTS
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THIS
SCENARIO
REPETITIVELY
APPEARS
BECAUSE
EACH
FLOW
ENTRY
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
AN
EXPIRING
TIMER
IN
OUR
SOLUTION
A
SENSOR
ONLY
SENDS
ONE
PACKET
IN
FOR
THE
FIRST
TABLE
MISS
AND
SUPPRESSES
SUBSEQUENT
PACKET
IN
WHOSE
ASSOCIATED
PACKETS
HAVE
THE
SAME
DESTINATION
ADDRESS
CLASS
OR

AS
THE
FIRST
PACKET
UNTIL
THE
CORRESPONDING
PACKET
OUT
OR
FLOW
MOD
IS
RECEIVED
OR
A
PREDEFINED
TIMEOUT
OCCURS
THE
RATIONALE
IS
TWOFOLD
FIRSTLY
BECAUSE
THE
END

SOF
CHANNEL
IS
SLOW
AS
IT
IS
IN
BAND
OF

THE
LATENCY
BETWEEN
SENDING
PACKET
IN
AND
RECEIVING
PACKET
OUT
OR
FLOW
MOD
IS
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
IN
OPENFLOW
THEREFORE
THERE
CAN
BE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
INCOMING
PACKETS
DURING
THIS
INTERVAL
SECONDLY
SINCE
THE
MAJOR
TRAFFIC
IN

THE

WHEN

FOCUSED
ON
THE

THE
GENERAL
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
THE
RATE
OF
THE

NEEDED
TO
ACHIEVE
THE
PERFECT
CSIT
MULTIPLEXING

SCALES
WELL
WITH
THE
FOR
EXAMPLE
FOR

IT
WAS
SHOWN
IN
THAT
THE
RATE
OF

SHOULD
SCALE
LINEARLY
WITH
SINCE
THE
CAPACITY
OF
THE
MIMO
BROADCAST
CHANNEL
ALSO
SCALES
LINEARLY
WITH
THIS
RESULT
SAYS
THAT
THE
OVERHEAD
FROM
FEEDBACK
WILL
NOT
OVERWHELM
THE
CAPACITY
GAINS
WE
NOW
FOCUS
ON
THE
SECOND
ISSUE
THE
ISSUE
OF
FEEDBACK
DELAY
THE
STANDARD
APPROACH
OF
DEALING
WITH

DELAY
IS
TO
EXPLOIT
THE
TIME
CORRELATION
OF
THE
CHANNEL
TO
PREDICT
THE
CURRENT
CHANNEL
STATE
FROM
THE
DELAYED
MEASUREMENTS
THE
PREDICTED

IS
THEN
USED
IN
PLACE
OF
THE
TRUE
CHANNEL
STATE
IN
A
SCHEME
DESIGNED
ASSUMING
PERFECT
CSIT
IS
AVAILABLE
HOWEVER
AS
THE
COHERENCE
TIME
OF
THE
CHANNEL
BECOMES
SHORTER
COMPARED
TO
THE
FEEDBACK
DELAY
DUE
TO
HIGHER
MOBILITY
FOR
EX

THE

INFORMATION
REVEALS
NO

ABOUT

AND

IN

WE
RAISE
THE
QUESTION
IS
THIS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
LIM
ITATION
IMPOSED
BY

DELAY
OR
IS
THIS
JUST
A
LIMITATION
OF
THE
PREDICTION
BASED
APPROACH
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IS
THERE
AN
OTHER
WAY
TO
USE
THE
DELAYED

TO
ACHIEVE
NONTRIVIAL

COMPLETELY

CHANNEL

INFORMATION
IS
STILL
VERY
USEFUL
FOR

WE
FOCUS
ON
A
CHANNEL
WHICH
HAS
RECEIVED
SIGNIFICANT
ATTENTION
IN
RECENT
YEARS
THE
MIMO
BROADCAST
CHANNEL
IN
PARTICULAR
WE
FOCUS
ON
A
SYSTEM
WHERE
THE
TRANS
MITTER
HAS
ANTENNAS
AND
THERE
ARE
RECEIVERS
EACH
WITH
A
SINGLE
RECEIVE
ANTENNA
THE
TRANSMITTER
WANTS
TO
SEND
AN
INDEPENDENT
DATA
STREAM
TO
EACH
RECEIVER
TO
MODEL
COMPLETELY
OUTDATED
CSI
WE
ALLOW
THE
CHANNEL
STATE
TO
BE
INDEPENDENT
FROM
ONE
SYMBOL
TIME
TO
THE
NEXT
AND
THE
CSI
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
BOTH
THE
TRANSMITTER
AND
THE
RECEIVERS
ONE
SYMBOL
TIME
LATER
THIS
MEANS
THAT
BY
THE
TIME
THE
FEEDBACK
REACHES
THE
TRANSMITTER
THE
CURRENT
CHANNEL
IS
ALREADY
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
WE
ALSO
ASSUME
THAT
THE
OVERALL

MATRIX
IS

AT

OUR
MAIN

IS
THAT
FOR

CAN
ACHIEVE
A

PER

IN

IN

WE
CAN
ACHIEVE
A

THIS

IT
IS
INSTRUCTIVE
TO
COMPARE
THIS

WITH
THE
CASE
WHEN
THERE
IS

THE

WHEN

IS

IS
UNKNOWN
FOR

WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
CSIT
IN
THE
CASE
WHEN
ALL

HAVE

IT
IS
EASY
TO
SEE
THAT
THE

OF

IS

FOR

THAT
AT

IN

THERE
IS

INFORMATION

CAN
BE
TRANSMITTED
TO
THAT
RECEIVER
WITHOUT
OTHER
RECEIVERS
OVERHEARING
IT
SAY
BY
USING
A
ZERO
FORCING
PRECODER
SO
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CROSS
INTERFERENCE
WHEN
THE
TRANSMITTER
DOES
NOT
KNOW
THE
CURRENT
CHANNEL
STATE
THIS
CANNOT
BE
DONE
AND
INFORMATION
INTENDED

WILL
BE
OVERHEARD

AT

THE

THE

ANOTHER

THE
SECOND
EFFECT
OF

THAT

BE
AVERAGED

SO
THAT
THE

IS
PREDOMINANTLY
LIMITED
BY

THIS
IS
INTUITIVELY
CLEAR
FOR

THIS

HOWEVER
UNDER

THE

ARISING

CHOOSING

THIS

CONCLUSIONS
IN

TO
ADVANCE
THE
THEORY
OF

IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
HAVE

BASED

WE
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THIS

BY
PROVIDING
A

TION
OF
THE

BEFORE

MECHANISMS
WE
ARE
THE
FIRST
ONES
TO
REPORT
A
STATISTICAL
CHARACTERIZATION
OF
THE
SELF

WE
HAVE

OF
OUR

SUCH
A

FOR

DEPLOYMENT
OF

IS
SELDOM
PROVIDED
IN

WORK
ON

WE
ARE
THE
FIRST
TO
CHARACTERIZE
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
DIGITAL
CANCELLATION
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
ANALOG
CAN
CELLATION
FOR
A
FULL
DUPLEX
IMPLEMENTATION
THE
CURRENT
BELIEF
IN
THE
LITERATURE
HAS
BEEN
THAT
DIGITAL
CANCELLATION
WILL
ALWAYS
HELP
IMPROVE
THE
TOTAL
CANCELLATION
FURTHER
IT
HAS
SOME
TIMES
BEEN
CONJECTURED
THAT
THE
TOTAL
ANALOG
PLUS
DIGITAL
CANCELLATION
WOULD
BE
EQUAL
TO
THE
SUM
OF
THE
CANCELLATIONS
MEASURED
INDEPENDENTLY
IN

WE
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
WHEN
DIGITAL
CANCELLATION
IS
PRECEDED
BY
ANALOG
CANCELLATION
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DIGITAL
CANCELLATION
VARIES
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE

THUS
ONLY
A
FULL

IMPLEMENTATION
CAN
REVEAL
THE
TRUE
BENEFITS
OF
COMBINED

IN
AN
ACTUAL

FINALLY
WHILE
OUR

ARE
BASED
ON
A
SINGLE

OF

WE
BELIEVE
OUR

ANALYZE
