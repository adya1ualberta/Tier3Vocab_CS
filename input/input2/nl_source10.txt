ARE

GENERIC

THEN

BY

GREAT
MANY
QUESTIONS

ACCORDING

OF

EXPERTS
DOUGLAS
VAN
DUYNE
JAMES
LANDAY
AND
JASON
HONG
THEY
PROVIDE
INSIGHTS
INTO

PROBLEMS
BY
DEFINING
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
A
PARTICULAR
ISSUE
AND
ITS
SOLUTION
IN
A
COMPACT
FORM
A
WELL
KNOWN
EXAMPLE
WOULD
BE
THE

SHOPS
WHERE
USERS
CAN
COLLECT
ALL
THE
ITEMS
THEY
WANT
TO
BUY
BEFORE
PLACING
THE
ORDER
FIGURE
THE
UI
PATTERN
CONCEPT
THE
PATTERN
APPROACH
AT
SAP
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
TWO
SPECIAL
FEATURES
FIRSTLY
IT
SEPARATES
THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
A
TASK
THAT
THE
USER
EXECUTES
FROM
ITS
REPRESENTATION
ON
THE
USER
INTERFACE
THIS
SEPARATION
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
THAT
THE
FLOOR
PLANS
AND
COMPONENTS
CAN
BE
STRUCTURED
BOTH
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PREVAILING
DESIGN
PARADIGM
AND
ALSO
IN
LINE
WITH
THE
SPECIFIC
FEATURES
OF
THE
TERMINAL
SUCH
AS
A
LARGE
MONITOR
ON
A
PC
OR
A
SMALL
MONITOR
ON
A
PDA
SECONDLY
THE
APPROACH
ONLY
WORKS
IF
GENERIC
USER
INTERFACE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
FOUND
FOR
GENERALLY
APPLICABLE
OR
GENERIC
TASKS
AFTER
ALL
THE
INTENTION
IS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
ONE
COMPONENT
FOR
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
APPLICATIONS
BOTH
TASKS
AND
THE
ELEMENTS
OF
THE

CAN

IN
A

IS
SIMPLE
ELEMENTS
CAN
BE
COMBINED
TO
PRODUCE

COMPLEX
ONES
THE
SEARCH
FOR
A
WORK
OBJECT
IS
ONE
EXAMPLE
OF
A
GENERIC
TASK
IT
IS
IRRELEVANT
WHETHER
THE
OBJECT
IS
AN
ORDER
A
DELIVERY
AN
INVOICE
OR
A
MATERIAL
THE
GENERAL
ASSUMPTION
IS
THAT
IF
GENERIC
TASKS
EXHIBIT
SIMILAR
PROPERTIES
FOR
A
SPECIFIC
NUMBER
OF
BUSINESS
PROCESSES
THEN
A
STANDARD
SOLUTION
CAN
BE
FOUND
ON
THE
USER
INTERFACE
FOR
INSTANCE
A
BUTTON
REPRESENTS
A
CLASSICAL
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
GENERIC
TRIGGER
FUNCTION
PROBLEM
THE
SAP
APPROACH
IS
ABOUT
MOVING
AWAY
FROM
THE
LEVEL
OF
THESE
ELEMENTARY
ACTIONS
AND
SOLUTIONS
SUCH
AS
ENTERING
TEXT
OR
CLICKING
A

BE
A

SEVERAL

CAN

OR
MORE
GENERIC
TASKS
SUCH
AS

PROVIDES
FOR
A
HIGHLY
CONSISTENT
SOLUTION
HOWEVER
IT
IS
ONLY
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
WITH
A
SMALL
NUMBER
OF

IN
THIS
APPLICATION
AREA
BECAUSE
THE
APPLICATIONS
HAVE
A
SIMILAR
STRUCTURE
NATURALLY

WE

ABOUT
HOW
TO

A
RESEARCH
PAPER
TO
BEGIN
THE
COURSE
HOWEVER
WE
CONSIDER
HOW
TO
READ
A
RESEARCH
PAPER
THIS
DISCUSSION
PRESUPPOSES
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
CAREFULLY
READ
A
RESEARCH
PAPER
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
FACT
THAT
I
ASSIGN
A
PAPER
IS
PROBABLY
A
GOOD
REASON
FOR
YOU
TO
READ
IT
YOU
MAY
ALSO
NEED
TO
CAREFULLY
READ
A
PAPER
IF
YOU
ARE
ASKED
TO
REVIEW
IT
OR
IF
IT
IS
RELEVANT
TO
YOUR
OWN
RESEARCH
WE
MIGHT
ALSO
LATER
DISCUSS
HOW
TO
SKIM
A
PAPER
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
DECIDE
WHETHER
A
PAPER
IS
WORTH
A
CAREFUL
READING
WHEN
YOU
READ
A
RESEARCH
PAPER
YOUR
GOAL
IS
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
SCIENTIFIC
CONTRIBUTIONS
THE
AUTHORS
ARE
MAKING
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
EASY
TASK
IT
MAY
REQUIRE
GOING
OVER
THE
PAPER
SEVERAL
TIMES
EXPECT
TO
SPEND
SEVERAL
HOURS
TO
READ
A
PAPER
HERE
ARE
SOME
INITIAL
GUIDELINES
FOR
HOW
TO
READ
A
PAPER
EAD
CRITICALLY
READING
A
RESEARCH
PAPER
MUST
BE
A
CRITICAL
PROCESS
YOU
SHOULD
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
THE
AUTHORS
ARE
ALWAYS
CORRECT
INSTEAD
BE
SUSPICIOUS
CRITICAL
READING
INVOLVES
ASKING
APPROPRIATE
QUESTIONS
IF
THE
AUTHORS
ATTEMPT
TO
SOLVE
A
PROBLEM
ARE
THEY
SOLVING
THE
RIGHT
PROBLEM
ARE
THERE
SIMPLE
SOLUTIONS
THE
AUTHORS
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
CONSIDERED
WHAT
ARE
THE
LIMITATIONS
OF
THE
SOLUTION
INCLUDING
LIMITATIONS
THE
AUTHORS
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
NOTICED
OR
CLEARLY
ADMITTED
ARE
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
THE
AUTHORS
MAKE
REASONABLE
IS
THE
LOGIC
OF
THE
PAPER
CLEAR
AND
JUSTIFIABLE
GIVEN
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
OR
IS
THERE
A
FLAW
IN
THE
REASONING
IF
THE
AUTHORS
PRESENT
DATA
DID
THEY
GATHER
THE
RIGHT
DATA
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
THEIR
ARGUMENT
AND
DID
THEY
APPEAR
TO
GATHER
IT
IN
THE
CORRECT
MANNER
DID
THEY
INTERPRET
THE
DATA
IN
A
REASONABLE
MANNER
WOULD
OTHER
DATA
BE
MORE
COMPELLING
EAD
CREATIVELY
READING
A
PAPER
CRITICALLY
IS
EASY
IN
THAT
IT
IS
ALWAYS
EASIER
TO
TEAR
SOMETHING
DOWN
THAN
TO
BUILD
IT
UP
READING
CREATIVELY
INVOLVES
HARDER
MORE
POSITIVE
THINKING
WHAT
ARE
THE
GOOD
IDEAS
IN
THIS
PAPER
DO
THESE
IDEAS
HAVE
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
OR
EXTENSIONS
THAT
THE
AUTHORS
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
THOUGHT
OF
CAN
THEY
BE
GENERALIZED
FURTHER
ARE
THERE
POSSIBLE
IMPROVEMENTS
THAT
MIGHT
MAKE
IMPORTANT
PRACTICAL
DIFFERENCES
IF
YOU
WERE
GOING
TO
START
DOING
RESEARCH
FROM
THIS
PAPER
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
NEXT
THING
YOU
WOULD
DO
AKE
NOTES
AS
YOU
READ
THE
PAPER
MANY
PEOPLE
COVER
THE
MARGINS
OF
THEIR
COPIES
OF
PAPERS
WITH
NOTES
USE
WHATEVER
STYLE
YOU
PREFER
IF
YOU
HAVE
QUESTIONS
OR
CRITICISMS
WRITE
THEM
DOWN
SO
YOU
DO
NOT
FORGET
THEM
UNDERLINE
KEY
POINTS
THE
AUTHORS
MAKE
MARK
THE
DATA
THAT
IS
MOST
IMPORTANT
OR
THAT
APPEARS
QUESTIONABLE
SUCH
EFFORTS
HELP
THE
FIRST
TIME
YOU
READ
A
PAPER
AND
PAY
BIG
DIVIDENDS
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
RE
READ
A
PAPER
AFTER
SEVERAL
MONTHS
WOULD
BE
EASIER
IF
MORE
RESEARCH
PAPERS
WERE
WELL
WRITTEN
BUT
AGAIN
WE
WILL
DISCUSS
WRITING
LATER
ON
FTER
THE
FIRST
READ
THROUGH
TRY
TO
SUMMARIZE
THE
PAPER
IN
ONE
OR
TWO
SENTENCES
ALMOST
ALL
GOOD
RESEARCH
PAPERS
TRY
TO
PROVIDE
AN
ANSWER
A
SPECIFIC
QUESTION
SOMETIMES
THE
QUESTION
IS
A
NATURAL
ONE
THAT
PEOPLE
SPECIFICALLY
SET
OUT
TO
ANSWER
SOMETIMES
A
GOOD
IDEA
JUST
ENDS
UP
ANSWERING
A
WORTHWHILE
QUESTION
IF
YOU
CAN
SUCCINCTLY
DESCRIBE
A
PAPER
YOU
HAVE
PROBABLY
RECOGNIZED
THE
QUESTION
THE
AUTHORS
STARTED
WITH
WITH
AND
THE
ANSWER
THEY
PROVIDE
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
FOCUSED
ON
THE
MAIN
IDEA
YOU
CAN
GO
BACK
AND
TRY
TO
OUTLINE
THE
PAPER
TO
GAIN
INSIGHT
INTO
MORE
SPECIFIC
DETAILS
INDEED
IF
SUMMARIZING
THE
PAPER
IN
ONE
OR
TWO
SENTENCES
IS
EASY
GO
BACK
AND
TRY
TO
DEEPEN
YOUR
OUTLINE
BY
SUMMARIZING
THE
THREE
OR
FOUR
MOST
IMPORTANT
SUBPOINTS
OF
THE
MAIN
IDEA
F
POSSIBLE
COMPARE
THE
PAPER
TO
OTHER
WORKS
SUMMARIZING
THE
PAPER
IS
ONE
WAY
TO
TRY
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SCIENTIFIC
CONTRIBUTION
OF
A
PAPER
BUT
TO
REALLY
GUAGE
THE
SCIENTIFIC
MERIT
YOU
MUST
COMPARE
THE
PAPER
TO
OTHER
WORKS
IN
THE
AREA
ARE
THE
IDEAS
REALLY
NOVEL
OR
HAVE
THEY
APPEARED
BEFORE
OF
COURSE
WE
DO
NOT
EXPECT
YOU
TO
BE
EXPERTS
AND
KNOW
THE
AREAS
AHEAD
OF
TIME
IN
THIS
CLASS
IT
IS
WORTH
MENTIONING
THAT
SCIENTIFIC
CONTRIBUTIONS
CAN
TAKE
ON
MANY
FORMS
SOME
PAPERS
OFFER
NEW
IDEAS
OTHERS
IMPLEMENT
IDEAS
AND
SHOW
HOW
THEY
WORK
OTHERS
BRING
PREVIOUS
IDEAS
TOGETHER
AND
UNITE
THEM
UNDER
A
NOVEL
FRAMEWORK
KNOWING
OTHER
WORK
IN
THE
AREA
CAN
HELP
YOU
TO
DETERMINE
WHICH
SORT
OF
CONTRIBUTION
A
PAPER
IS
ACTUALLY
MAKING
FOR
THIS
CLASS
I
WILL
OFTEN
ASK
YOU
TO
PROVIDE
A
SHORT
ONE
PAGE
REVIEW
OF
A
PAPER
ALTHOUGH
THIS
MAY
SOUND
LIKE
A
SIMPLE
ASSIGNMENT
I
EXPECT
THAT
IT
WILL
TAKE
A
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
BEGINNING
REMEMBER
I
AM
EXPECTING
IT
TO
TAKE
SEVERAL
HOURS
JUST
TO
READ
THE
PAPER
KEEPING
THE
ABOVE
IN
MIND
AS
YOU
READ
THE
PAPER
SHOULD
MAKE
THE

EASIER
YOUR

THEREFORE
THE
AMOUNT

SHOULD
BE
LIMITED
TO
INTRODUCING
MAJOR
DISCUSSION
POINTS
MISSED
BY
THE

THE

ROLE
IS
TO
FOCUS
MORE
ON
INTEGRATING

AND
ON
STEERING
THE

THAN
ON
LECTURING
TO
THE

FOR
THE

EACH

THAT
CAN
SUPPLEMENT
THE

ASSIGNED
TO

CRITIQUED
IDEALLY
THE
STUDENTS
SHOULD
READ

CONSIDER
THESE

HOWEVER
FROM
A
PRACTICAL
STANDPOINT
IT
IS
RECOGNIZED
THAT
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
OF
THEIR

TIME
FOR
THE

WILL
FOCUS
ON
THE
PRIMARY

THUS
IT
REMAINS

TO

THAT

THERE
MAY
BE

WEEK
INTRODUCTION
TO
ACCESSIBILITY
ISSUES
THE
GOAL
OF
WEEK
WAS
TO
RECOGNIZE
THAT
WE
ALL
HAVE
DISABILITIES
IN
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
OUR
LIFE
AND
THAT
THESE
DISABILITIES
MAY
HINDER
ACCESSIBILITY
TO
CERTAIN
ASPECTS
OF
LIFE
ACHIEVING
THIS
GOAL
INVOLVED
IDENTIFYING
OUR
OWN
DISABILITIES
AND
NEEDS
ACCEPTING
THE
DISABILITIES
AND
NEEDS
OF
OTHERS
AND
DEVELOPING
AN
INITIAL
APPROACH
TO
ACCESSIBILITY
WE
SPECIFICALLY
AVOIDED
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
LIMIT
PRIORITIZE
OR
EVALUATE
THE
SET
OF
DISABILITIES
CLAIMED
BY
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
WAY
WE
RECOGNIZED
THAT
ALL
OF
US
HAVE
SOME
DISABILITIES
AND
THAT
WHAT
REALLY
MATTERS
IS
TO
IDENTIFY
BARRIERS
WE
HAVE
THAT
PREVENT
FULL
ACCESS
TO
SOME
ASPECT
OF
LIFE
DUE
TO
DESIGNS
THAT
REQUIRE
ABILITIES
THAT
WE
DO
NOT
POSSESS
BY
EXPANDING
OUR
SET
OF
DISABILITIES
FAR
BEYOND
THOSE
THAT
ARE
RECOGNIZED
IN
APPROACHES
SUCH
AS
US
SECTION
WE
WERE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
ALL
PARTICIPANTS
RECOGNIZE
THAT
PROVIDING
ACCESSIBILITY
IS
MORE
THAN
JUST
AN
ACCOMMODATION
IT
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
EXPECTATION
OF
APPROPRIATE
DESIGN
IN
THIS
WAY
WE
ALSO
AVOIDED
PROVIDING
ARTIFICIAL
BOUNDARIES
ON
ACCESSIBILITY
OPENING
UP
THE
COURSE
TO
INVESTIGATE
ALL
ASPECTS
THAT
COULD
CONTRIBUTE
TO
GREATER
ACCESSIBILITY

ALSO
AVOIDED
ANY
TENDENCY
TO
ARGUE
MY
DISABILITY
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
YOURS
WEEK
UNIVERSAL
ACCESSIBILITY
THE
GOAL
OF
WEEK
WAS
TO
GO
BEYOND
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
NEEDS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
AND
RECOGNIZE
THE
NEEDS
AND
IMPLICATIONS
OF
ACHIEVING
UNIVERSAL
ACCESSIBILITY
SINCE
WE
HAD
ALREADY
ACHIEVED
CONSENSUS
ON
THE

THIS

SHOWED

A

CONSISTED

AROUND
INCOMING
PULL

CHIMED
IN
ON
THE

AROUND
A

SOMEONE
THERE
WAS
A
CLEAR

THAT

HAD
A
VIEW
OF
ELSE
HAD
SUBMITTED
BECAUSE
THE

AFFECTED
THE
TRAJECTORY
FOR

AND
THERE
WAS
A
NEED
FOR
FUNCTIONALITY
HIS
COMPANY
DEPENDED
ON
OTHERS
TO
GET
BUY
IN
BEFORE
MAKING

DEVELOPERS
WOULD
ALSO
HANDLE
CONFLICTING
OR

PROJECT
OWNERS
WOULD
OFTEN
SEE
POTENTIAL
PROBLEMS
THAT
A

DIRECTLY
MODIFYING
THE

TO

WOULD
CAUSE
WITH
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
CODE
ADDRESS
THE
PROBLEM
TRANSPARENCY
OR
WITH
CHANGES
THEY
WANTED
TO
MAKE
IN
THE
FUTURE
IN
BOTH
SUPPORTED
THIS
BEHAVIOR
BECAUSE
THE
CODE
ARTIFACTS
OF
THE
CASES
THEIR
REACTION
WAS
BASED
ON
IMPLICIT
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT

PROJECT
WERE
OPEN
AND
ACCESSIBLE
AND
THE
CODE
ORGANIZATION
OR
THEIR
FUTURE
PLANS
FOR
THE

THEIR
VISIBILITY
OF

MEANT
THE

OWNER
KNEW
EXACTLY
VISION
FOR
THE

AS
THEY
OFTEN
CALLED
IT
WHY
SOMETHING
WAS
NO
LONGER
WORKING
THE

OWNERS
I
COULD
TELL
THAT
WAS
ACTUALLY
GOING
TO
CAUSE
SOME
SERIOUS
IN
THIS
CASE
WERE

OF
OTHERS

AND
THEN
HAD
TO
PROBLEMS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
SO
I
JUST
RESPONDED
I
ALWAYS
THANK
LOBBY
AND
NEGOTIATE
WITH
THE
DEPENDENT
PROJECT
OWNER
TO
GET
THEM
BECAUSE
IT
A
BIG
HELP
WHEN
PEOPLE
CONTRIBUTE
BACK
BUT
IT
THEIR

ACCEPTED

WOULDN

I
KIND

EXPLAINED

WHY
IT
DIDN

OF

TO
GIVE
YOU
A

VARIOUS

CONCEPTUAL

THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF

THESE
CAN

TWO
MAIN
CATEGORIES
THOSE

THE
MOST
TYPES
OF

THAT

ARE
INSTRUCTING
CONVERSING
MANIPULATING
AND
NAVIGATING
EXPLORING
AND
BROWSING
A
FIRST
THING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
THE
VARIOUS
KINDS
OF
ACTIVITY
ARE
NOT
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
AS
THEY
CAN
BE
CARRIED
OUT
TOGETHER
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
SOMEONE
TO

WHILE

OR
NAVIGATE
AN
ENVIRONMENT
WHILE
BROWSING
HOW
EVER
EACH
HAS
DIFFERENT
PROPERTIES
AND
SUGGESTS
DIFFERENT
WAYS
OF
BEING
DEVELOPED
AT
THE
INTERFACE
THE
FIRST
ONE
IS
BASED
ON
THE
IDEA
OF
LETTING
THE

ISSUE
INSTRUC
TIONS
TO
THE

WHEN

THIS
CAN
BE
DONE
IN
VARIOUS

ON
A
TOUCH
SCREEN
SPEAKING
ALOUD
COMMANDS
PRESSING

OR
USING
A
COMBINATION
OF

THE
SECOND
ONE
IS
BASED
ON
THE
USER
CONVERSING
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
AS
THOUGH
TALKING
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE

SPEAK
TO
THE
SYSTEM
OR
TYPE
IN
QUESTIONS
TO
WHICH
THE
SYSTEM
REPLIES
VIA
TEXT
OR

OUTPUT
THE
THIRD
TYPE
IS
BASED
ON
ALLOWING
USERS
TO
MANIPULATE
AND
NAVIGATE
THEIR
WAY
THROUGH
AN
ENVIRON

OF
VIRTUAL
OBJECTS
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
VIRTUAL
ENVIRONMENT
SHARES
SOME
OF
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
ALLOWING
USERS
TO
USE
THEIR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HOW
PHYSICAL
OBJECTS
BEHAVE
WHEN
INTERACTING
WITH
VIRTUAL
OBJECTS
THE
FOURTH
KIND
IS
BASED
ON
THE
SYSTEM
PROVIDING
INFORMATION
THAT
IS
STRUCTURED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
AS
TO
ALLOW
USERS
TO
FIND
OUT
OR
LEARN
THINGS
WITHOUT

IS
THEY
THEN
NEED
TO
CONSIDER
HOW
BEST
TO
SUPPORT
THE
ACTIVITY
OF
REQUESTING
INFORMATION
IS
IT
PREFERABLE
TO
ENABLE
THE
TOURISTS
TO
ASK
QUESTIONS
OF
THE
SYSTEM
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
HAVING
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
ANOTHER
HUMAN
BEING
OR
WOULD
IT
BE
MORE
APPROPRIATETO
ALLOW
THEM
TO
ASK
QUESTIONS
AS
IF

ALTERNATIVELY
WOULD
THEY
PREFER

A
CONCEPTUAL
LEVEL
SOME
PEOPLE
MAY
TAKE
THE
UNDERLYING
CONCEPTUAL
MODEL
TOO
LITERALLY
AND
EXPECT
CERTAIN
THINGS
TO
HAPPEN
AT
THE
INTERFACE
IN
THE
WAY
THEY
WOULD
IN
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
A
WELL
KNOWN
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
PHENOMENON
IS
OF
NEW
MAC
USERS
BEING
CONCEPTUAL

FIED
OF
DRAGGING
THE
ICON

TO

ICON
ON

EJECT
IT
FROM

FOR
FEAR
OF
DELETING
IT
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
FILES
ARE
WHEN
PLACED
IN
THE
TRASH
CAN
THE
CONCEPTUAL
CONFUSION
ARISES
BECAUSE
THE
DESIGNERS
OPTED
TO
USE
THE
SAME
ACTION
DROPPING
ON
THE
SAME
OBJECT
TRASH
CAN
FOR
TWO
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
OPERATIONS
DELETING
AND
EJECTING
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
NOT
ALL
TASKS
CAN
BE
DESCRIBED
BY
OBJECTS
AND
NOT
ALL
ACTIONS
CAN
BE
DONE
DIRECTLY
SOME
TASKS
ARE
BETTER
ACHIEVED
THROUGH
ISSUING

SEVERAL

HAVE
CRITICIZED
THE

THAT

LOGICALLY

IT

IF
THIS

A

THAT

ANOTHER
ARGUMENT
AGAINST

IS
THAT
THEY

RESTRICTING
THE
KINDS

THAT

AN
EXAMPLE

A
VERY
INEFFICIENT

A

THAT

A

THIS

BUT
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
THINKING
ABOUT
THE

THE

I
THINK
INTERACTION
DESIGN
IS
ABOUT
DESIGNING
A
SPACE
FOR

WHERE
THAT
SPACE
HAS
TO
HAVE
A
TEMPORAL
FLOW
IT
HAS

ABOUT

AND

YOU
MOVED
INTO

I
GOT
INTO
INTERACTION
DESIGN
THROUGH
A
COUPLE
OF
INTERMEDIATE
STEPS
I
STARTED
OUT
DOING
RESEARCH
INTO
ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE
I
BECAME
INTERESTED
IN
HOW
PEO
PLE
INTERACT
WITH
COMPUTERS
IN
PARTICULAR
WHEN
USING
ORDINARY
LANGUAGE
IT
BECAME
CLEAR
AFTER
YEARS
OF
WORKING
ON
THAT
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
COMPUTER
WAS
A
LONG
WAY
OFF
FROM
MATCHING
HUMAN
ABILITIES
MORE
OVER
USING
NATURAL
LANGUAGE
WITH
A
COMPUTER
WHEN
IT
DOESN
T
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
YOU
CAN
BE
VERY
FRUSTRATING
AND
IN
FACT
A
VERY
BAD
WAY
TO
INTERACT
WITH
IT
SO
RATHER
THAN
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
COMPUTER
TO
IMITATE
THE
PERSON
I
BECAME
INTERESTED
IN
OTHER
WAYS
OF
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
WHAT
THE
COMPUTER
CAN
DO
WELL
AND
WHAT
THE
PERSON
CAN
DO
WELL
THAT
LED
ME
INTO
THE
GENERAL
FIELD
OF
HCI
AS
I
BEGAN
TO
LOOK
AT
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
IN
THAT
FIELD
AND
TO
STUDY
IT
IT
BECAME
CLEAR
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
OTHER
AREAS
OF
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
THE
KEY
ISSUES
WERE
ABOUT
HOW
THE
TECHNOLOGY
FITS
WITH
WHAT
PEOPLE
COULD
DO
AND
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
DO
IN
CONTRAST
MOST
OF
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
IS
REALLY
DOMI
NATED
BY
HOW
THE
MECHANISMS
OPERATE
I
WAS
VERY
ATTRACTED
TO
THINKING
MORE
IN
THE
STYLE
OF
DESIGN
DISCIPLINES
LIKE
PRODUCT
DESIGN
URBAN
DE
SIGN
ARCHITECTURE
AND
SO
ON
I
REALIZED
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
APPROACH
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
CALL
A
DESIGN
WAY
THAT
PUTS
THE
TECHNICAL
ASSPECTS
INTO
THE
BACKGROUND
WITH
RESPECT
TO
UNDERSTANDING
THE
INTERACTION
THROUGH
LOOKING
AT
THESE
DESIGN
DISCIPLINES
I
REALIZED
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
UNIQUE
ABOUT
INTERACTION
DESIGN
WHICH
IS
THAT
IT
HAS
A
DIALOGIC
TEMPORAL
ELEMENT
BY
YR
COULD
YOU
TELL
ME
A
BIT
MORE
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
THINK
IS
INVOLVED
IN
INTERACTION
DESIGN
ONE
OF
THE
BIGGEST
INFLUENCES
IS
PRODUCT
DESIGN
I
THINK
THAT
INTERACTION
DESIGN
OVERLAPS
WITH
IT
BE
CAUSE
THEY
BOTH
TAKE
A
VERY
STRONG
USER
ORIENTED
VIEW
BOTH
ARE
CONCERNED
WITH
FINDING
A
USER
GROUP
UNDER
STANDING
THEIR
NEEDS
THEN
USING
THAT
UNDERSTANDING
TO
COME
UP
WITH
NEW
IDEAS
THEY
MAY
BE
ONES
THAT
THE
USERS
DON
T
EVEN
REALIZE
THEY
NEED
IT
IS
THEN
A
MATTER
OF
TRYING
TO
TRANSLATE
WHO
IT
IS
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
AND
WHY
THEY
ARE
DOING
IT
INTO
POSSIBLE
INNOVATIONS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
PRODUCT
DESIGN
IT
IS
PRODUCTS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
INTERACTION
DESIGN
IT
IS
THE
WAY
THAT
THE
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
INTERACTS
WITH
THE
PERSON
YR
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
ARE
IMPORTANT
INPUTS
INTO
THE
DESIGN
PROCESS
ONE
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
DESIGN
FIELDS
AS
OP
POSED
TO
TRADITIONAL
ENGINEERING
FIELDS
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
MUCH
MORE
DEPENDENCE
ON
CASE
STUDIES
AND
EXAMPLES
THAN
ON
FORMULAS
WHEREAS
AN
ENGINEER
KNOWS
HOW
TO
CALCULATE
SOMETHING
AN
ARCHITECT
OR
A
DESIGNER
IS
WORKING
IN
A
TRADITION
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
HISTORY
OVER
TIME
OF
OTHER
THINGS
PEOPLE
HAVE
DONE
PEOPLE
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THE
SECRET
OF
GREAT
DESIGN
IS
TO
KNOW
WHAT
TO
STEAL
AND
TO
KNOW
WHEN
SOME
ELEMENT
OR
SOME
WAY
OF
DOING
THINGS
WORKED
BEFORE
WILL
BE
APPROPRIATE
TO
YOUR
SETTING
AND
THEN
ADAPT
IT
OF
COURSE
YOU
CAN
T
APPLY
IT
DIRECTLY
SO
I
THINK
A
BIG
PART
OF
DOING
GOOD
DESIGN
IS
EXPERIENCE
AND
EXPOSURE
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
SEEN
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
IN
PRACTICE
AND
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
IS
GOOD
AND
BAD
ABOUT
THEM
TO
THEN
USE
THESE
TO
INFORM
YOUR
DESIGN
YR
HOW
DO
YOU
SEE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
STUDY
ING
INTERACTION
DESIGN
AND
THE
PRACTICE
OF
IT
IS
THERE
A
GOOD
DIALOG
BETWEEN
RESEARCH
AND
PRACTICE
TW
ACADEMIC
STUDY
OF
INTERACTION
DESIGN
IS
A
TRICKY
AREA
BECAUSE
SO
MUCH
OF
IT
DEPENDS
ON
A
KIND
OF
TACIT
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
COMES
THROUGH
EXPERIENCE
AND
INTERVIEW
EXPOSURE
IT
IS
NOT
THE
KIND
OF
THING
YOU
CAN
SET
DOWN
EASILY
AS
SAY
YOU
CAN
SCIENTIFIC
FORMULAS
A
LOT
OF
DESIGN
TENDS
TO
BE
METHODOLOGICAL
IT
IS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
DESIGN
PER
SE
BUT
IS
MORE
ABOUT
HOW
YOU
GO
ABOUT
DOING
DESIGN
IN
PARTICULAR
KNOWING
WHAT
ARE
THE
APPROPRIATE
STEPS
TO
TAKE
AND
HOW
YOU
PUT
THEM
TOGETHER
YR
HOW
DO
YOU
SEE
THE
FIELD
OF
INTERACTION
DESIGN
TAKING
ON
BOARD
THE
CURRENT
EXPLOSION
IN
NEW
TECH
NOLOGIES
FOR
EXAMPLE
MOBILE
UBIQUITOUS
INFRARED
AND
SO
ON
IS
IT
DIFFERENT
SAY
FROM
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
IT
WAS
JUST
ABOUT
DESIGNING
SOFTWARE
APPLICATIONS
TO
SIT
ON
THE
DESKTOP
I
THINK
A
REAL
CHANGE
IN
PEOPLE
THINKING
HAS
BEEN
TO
MOVE
FROM
INTERFACE
DESIGN
TO
INTERACTION
DE
SIGN
THIS
HAS
BEEN
PUSHED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
DO
HAVE
ALL
KINDS
OF
DEVICES
NOWADAYS
INTERFACE
DESIGN
USED
TO
MEAN
GRAPHICAL
INTERFACES
WHICH
MEANT
DESIGNING
MENUS
AND
OTHER
WIDGETS
BUT
NOW
WHEN
YOU
RE
TALK
ING
ABOUT
HANDHELD
DEVICES
GESTURE
INTERFACES
TELE
PHONE
INTERFACES
AND
SO
ON
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
YOU
CAN
T
FOCUS
JUST
ON
THE
WIDGETS
THE
WIDGETS
MAY
BE
PART
OF
ANY
ONE
OF
THESE
DEVICES
BUT
THE
DESIGN
THINKING
AS
A
WHOLE
HAS
TO
FOCUS
ON
THE
INTERACTION
YR
ADVICE
WOULD
YOU
GIVE
TO
A
STUDENT
COMING
INTO
THE
FIELD
ON
WHAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
LEARNING
AND
FOR
I
THINK
A
STUDENT
WHO
WANTS
TO
LEARN
THIS
FIELD
SHOULD
THINK
OF
IT
AS
A
KIND
OF
DUAL
PROCESS
THAT
IS
WHAT
DONALD
SCHON
CALLS
REFLECTION
IN
ACTION
NEEDING
BOTH
THE
ACTION
AND
THE
REFLECTION
IT
IS
IM
PORTANT
TO
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
TRYING
TO
BUILD
THINGS
THAT
EXPERIENCE
CAN
BE
FROM
OUTSIDE
WORK
PROJECTS
AND
COURSES
WHERE
YOU
ARE
ACTUALLY
EN
GAGED
IN
MAKING
SOMETHING
WORK
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
YOU
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
STEP
BACK
AND
LOOK
AT
IT
NOT
AS
WHAT
DO
I
NEED
TO
DO
NEXT
BUT
FROM
THE
PERSPEC
TIVE
OF
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
AND
HOW
THAT
FITS
INTO
THE
LARGER
PICTURE
YR
ARE
THERE
ANY
CLASSIC
CASE
STUDIES
THAT
STAND
OUT
AS
GOOD
EXEMPLARS
OF
INTERACTIONDESIGN
YOU
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
IMPOR
TANT
IN
THE
PAST
I
STILL
USE
THE
XEROX
STAR
AS
AN
EXEM
PLAR
BECAUSE
SO
MUCH
OF
WHAT
WE
USE
TODAY
WAS
THERE
WHEN
YOU
GO
BACK
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
STAR
YOU
SEE
IT
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
WHEN
IT
WAS
FIRST
CREATED
I
ALSO
THINK
SOME
EXEMPLARS
THAT
ARE
VERY
INTERESTING
ARE
ONES
THAT
NEVER
SUCCEEDED
COMMERCIALLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
USE
THE
SYSTEM
THAT
WAS
DEVELOPED
FOR
PEN
COM
PUTERS
BY
GO
AGAIN
THEY
WERE
THINKING
FRESH
THEY
SET
OUT
TO
DO
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
AND
THEY
WERE
MUCH
MORE
CONSCIOUS
OF
THE
DESIGN
ISSUES
THAN
SOMEBODY
WHO
WAS
SIMPLY
ADAPTING
THE
NEXT
VERSION
OF
SOMETHING
THAT
ALREADY
EXISTED
IS
ANOTHER
GOOD
EXAM
PLE
BECAUSE
THEY
LOOKED
AT
THE
PROBLEM
IN
A
DIFFERENT
WAY
TO
MAKE
SOMETHING
WORK
ANOTHER
INTERESTING
EX
EMPLAR
WHICH
OTHER
PEOPLE
MAY
NOT
AGREE
WITH
IS
MI
CROSOFT
BOB
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
A
SUCCESSFUL
PROGRAM
BECAUSE
IT
WASN
T
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
A
FIRST
EXPLORATION
OF
A
CERTAIN
STYLE
OF
INTERACTION
USING
ANIMATED
AGENTS
YOU
CAN
SEE
CLEARLY
FROM
THESE
EXEMPLARS
WHAT
DESIGN
TRADE
OFFS
THE
DESIGNERS
WERE
MAKING
AND
WHY
AND
THEN
YOU
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
YR
FINALLY
WHAT
ARE
THE
BIGGEST
CHALLENGES
FACING
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
AREA
TW
I
THINK
ONE
OF
THE
BIGGEST
CHALLENGES
IS
WHAT
PELLE
EHN
CALLS
THE
DIALECTIC
BETWEEN
TRADITION
AND
TRANSCENDENCE
THAT
IS
PEOPLE
WORK
AND
LIVE
IN
CER
TAIN
WAYS
ALREADY
AND
THEY
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TO
ADAPT
THAT
WITHIN
A
SMALL
RANGE
BUT
THEY
DON
T
HAVE
AN
UN
DERSTANDING
OR
A
FEEL
FOR
WHAT
IT
WOULD
MEAN
TO
MAKE
A
RADICAL
CHANGE
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
CHANGE
WAY
OF
DOING
BUSINESS
ON
THE
INTERNET
BEFORE
IT
WAS
AROUND
OR
TO
CHANGE
THEIR
WAY
OF
WRITING
FROM
PEN
AND
PAPER
WHEN
WORD
PROCESSORS
WEREN
T
AROUND
I
THINK
WHAT
THE
DESIGNER
IS
TRYING
TO
DO
IS
ENVISION
THINGS
FOR
USERS
THAT
THE
USERS
CAN
T
YET
ENVISION
THE
HARD
PART
IS
NOT
FIXING
LITTLE
PROBLEMS
BUT
DESIGNING
THINGS
THAT
ARE
BOTH
INNOVATIVE
AND
THAT

FIGURE
TWO
DIFFERENT
WAYS
OF
STRUC
TURING
THE

AT
THE
INTER

MAKES
IT
MUCH
EASIER
TO

THAN
THE

AT

AND
SECONDS
TO

THE

IN
THE

WHY
IS
THIS
SO
CONSIDERING
THAT
BOTH
DISPLAYS
HAVE
THE
SAME
DENSITY
OF
INFORMATION
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
IS
THE
WAY
THE
CHARACTERS
ARE
GROUPED
IN
THE

IN
THE

THEY
ARE
GROUPED
INTO
VERTICAL
CATEGORIES
OF

PLACE
KIND

THAT

BE
TWEEN

THE

HOWEVER
IT
IS
MUCH
HARDER
TO
FIND
THE
INFORMATION
IN
THE
BOTTOM
SCREEN
THAN
IN
THE
TOP
SCREEN
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
THAT
THE
INFORMATION
IS
VERY
POORLY
STRUCTURED
IN
THE
BOTTOM
MAKING
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
FIND
THE
INFORMATION
IN
THE
TOP
THE
INFORMATION
HAS
BEEN
ORDERED
INTO
MEANINGFUL
CATEGORIES
WITH
BLANK
SPACING
BE
TWEEN
THEM
MAKING
IT
EASIER
TO
SELECT
THE
NECESSARY
INFORMATION
PERCEPTION
REFERS
TO
HOW

IS
ACQUIRED
FROM
THE

VIA
THE
DIFFERENT
SENSE
ORGANS

EARS
FINGERS
AND
TRANSFORMED
INTO

IT
IS
A
COMPLEX
PROCESS
INVOLVING
OTHER
COGNITIVE
PROCESSES
SUCH
AS
MEMORY
ATTENTION
AND

VISION
IS
THE
WHAT
IS
COGNITION
MOST
DOMINANT
SENSE
FOR
SIGHTED
INDIVIDUALS
FOLLOWED
BY
HEARING
AND
TOUCH
WITH
RESPECT
TO
INTERACTION
DESIGN
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
PRESENT
INFORMATION
IN
A
WAY
THAT
CAN
BE
READILY
PERCEIVED
IN
THE
MANNER
INTENDED
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
MANY
WAYS
TO
DESIGN
ICONS
THE
KEY
IS
TO
MAKE
THEM
EASILY
DISTINGUISHABLE
FROM
ONE
AN
OTHER
AND
TO
MAKE
IT
SIMPLE
TO
RECOGNIZE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
INTENDED
TO
REPRESENT
NOT
LIKE
THE
ONES
IN

COMBINATIONS
OF
DIFFERENT
MEDIA
NEED
ALSO
TO
BE
DESIGNED
TO
ALLOW

THE
COMPOSITE
INFORMATION
REPRESENTED
IN
THEM
IN
THE
WAY
INTENDED
THE
USE
OF

TO
BE
COORDINATED

THEY

MAKES
HIM
TO

THAT

THAT

WE

IS

THAT

TO

LEARN
A

AND
USE

WHAT

WHEN

IS
THAT

IN

AND

THE
FIRST
OPTION
WHEN
ASKED
WHY
A
TYPICAL
EXPLANATION
THAT
IS

IS
THAT

AND
PUT
THE
PIZZA
IN

THEY
THINK
IT
IS
AT

SOME
PEOPLE
ANSWER
THAT
THEY
WOULD

THE
OVEN
TO
A
HIGHER
TEMPERATURE
IN

TO
WARM
IT
UP
MORE
QUICKLY
ELECTRIC
OVENS
WORK
ON
THE

PRINCIPLE
AS

AND
SO

UP
ANY

THERE
IS

THE

OF

A

ANOTHER

A
MAIN
EMPHASIS
HAS
BEEN
ON
TRANSFORMING
THEORETICAL

INTO
TOOLS
THAT

USED
BY

FOR

THE

THIS

THAT

EACH
OF

ONE
OF

IS
THAT

SEE
CHAPTER
FOR

ON
THIS
ANOTHER
APPROACH
HAS
BEEN
TO
PRODUCE
VARIOUS

PRINCIPLES
SUCH
AS
THE
ONES
WE
DISCUSSED
IN
CHAPTER
MORE
SPECIFIC
ONES
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
PROPOSED
FOR
DESIGNING
MULTIMEDIA
AND
VIRTUAL
REALITY
APPLICATIONS
ROGERS
AND
SCAIFE
THOMAS
GREEN
HAS
ALSO
PROPOSED
A
FRAMEWORK
OF
COGNITIVE
DIMENSIONS
HIS
OVERARCHING
GOAL
IS
TO
DEVELOP
A
SET
OF
HIGH
LEVEL
CONCEPTS
THAT
ARE
BOTH
VALUABLE
AND
EASY
TO
USE
FOR
EVALUATING
THE
DESIGNS
OF
INFORMATIONAL
ARTIFACTS
SUCH
AS
SOFTWARE
AP
PLICATIONS
AN
EXAMPLE
DIMENSION
FROM
THE
FRAMEWORK
IS
VISCOSITY
WHICH
SIMPLY
REFERS
TO
RESISTANCE
TO
LOCAL
CHANGE
THE
ANALOGY
OF
STIRRING
A
SPOON
IN
SYRUP
HIGH
VISCOSITY
VERSUS
MILK
LOW
VISCOSITY
QUICKLY
GIVES
THE
IDEA
HAVING
UNDERSTOOD
THE
CONCEPT
IN
A
FAMILIAR
CONTEXT
GREEN
THEN
SHOWS
HOW
THE
DIMENSION
CAN
BE
FURTHER
EXPLORED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
VARIOUS
ASPECTS
OF
INTERACTING
WITH
THE
INFORMATION
STRUCTURE
OF
A
SOFTWARE
APPLICATION
IN
A
NUTSHELL
THE
CONCEPT
IS
USED
TO
EXAMINE
HOW
MUCH
EXTRA
WORK
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IF
YOU
CHANGE
YOUR
MIND
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF
VISCOSITY
ARE
DESCRIBED
SUCH
AS
KNOCK
ON
VISCOSITY
WHERE
PERFORMING
ONE
GOAL
RELATED
ACTION
MAKES
NECESSARY
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
A
WHOLE
TRAIN
OF
EXTRANEOUS
ACTIONS
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
CONSTRAINT
DENSITY
THE
NEW
STRUCTURE
THAT
RESULTS
FROM
PERFORMING
THE
FIRST
ACTION
VIOLATES
SOME
CONSTRAINT
THAT
MUST
BE
RECTIFIED
BY
THE
SECOND
ACTION
WHICH
IN
TURN
LEADS
TO
A
DIFFERENT
VIOLATION
AND
SO
ON
AN
EXAMPLE
IS
EDITING
A
DOCUMENT
USING
A
WORD
PROCESSOR
WITHOUT
WIDOW
CONTROL
THE
ACTION
OF
INSERTING
A
SENTENCE
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
DOCUMENT
MEANS
THAT
THE
USER
MUST
THEN
GO
THROUGH
THE
REST
OF
THE

TO
CHECK
THAT
ALL
THE
HEADERS
AND
BODIES
OF

STILL
LIE

SUMMARY
THE
AIM
OF
THIS

IS
FOR

IS
FOR
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE

IT
AND
HOW
IT

THEN
ANSWER
THE

QUESTIONS
ABBREVIATED
FROM

HOW
MUCH
MONEY
ARE
YOU
ALLOWED
TO
TAKE
OUT
IF
YOU
TOOK
THIS
OUT
AND
THEN
WENT
TO
ANOTHER

AND
TRIED
TO
WITHDRAW
THE

AMOUNT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN

IS
ON

HOW
IS
THE

WHY
ARE
THERE

ARE
THEY
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF

AHEAD
DURING
THE

TO
THE

WHY
DOES
IT
STAY

DO
YOU
COUNT

WHY
NEXT
ASK
TWO

PEOPLE
USE
VARIOUS
WAYS
OF
INDICATING
HOW
LONG
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO

AND
ON
WHAT
TOPIC
FOR

A
SPEAKER
MIGHT
SAY
RIGHT
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THEIR

IN
THE
CONVERSATION
THAT
HE
HAS
THREE
THINGS
TO
SAY
A
SPEAKER
MAY
ALSO
EXPLICITLY
REQUEST
A
CHANGE
IN
SPEAKER
BY
SAYING
OK
THAT
ALL
I
WANT
TO

WHAT

TO

OTHERS
KNOW
THAT
THEIR

YES
WHAT

MAKE

FOR
THE

A

INSTEAD
CONTINUE

BE
MAKING
IT
GLARINGLY
OBVIOUS
IT
IS
THE

SOME

MANY
A

A
TEACHER
WILL
TRY
TO
HAND
OVER
THE

TO
A

IN
A
SEMINAR
BY
STARING
AT
HER
AND
ASKING
A
SPECIFIC
QUESTION
ONLY
TO
SEE
THE

LOOK
AT
THE

AND
SAY
NOTHING
THE
OUTCOME
IS
AN
EMBARRASSING
SILENCE

LOWED

EITHER
THE

OTHER

MISINTERPRETS
IT

SOMETHING
ELSE
IN
SOCIAL
MECHANISMS
IN

SUCH

THE

B
YOU
GO
DOWN
HERE
FOR
TWO

AND
THEN
TAKE
A
RIGHT
POINTING
TO
THE
RIGHT
GO
ON
TILL
YOU
GET
TO
THE
LIGHTS
AND
THEN
IT
IS
ON
THE
LEFT
A
OH
SO
I
GO
ALONG
HERE
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
BLOCKS
AND
THEN
TAKE
A
RIGHT
AND
THE
CINEMA
IS
AT
THE

POINTING
AHEAD
OF
HIM
A
NO
YOU
GO
ON
THIS
STREET
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF

GESTURING
MORE
VIGOROUSLY
THAN
BEFORE
TO
THE

TO
THE

AHHHH
I

YOU
MEANT
THAT

SO
IT
THIS
ONE

DI

AS
THE

A
UH
HUM
YES
THAT
RIGHT
THIS
ONE
DETECTING

REQUIRES
THE

WHAT
THE

SAYS
OR
DOES
NOT
SAY
ONCE
THEY
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
THE
NA
TURE
OF
THE

THEY
CAN
THEN
GO
ABOUT
REPAIRING
IT
AS
SHOWN
IN
THE
ABOVE
EXAMPLE
WHEN
THE

MISUNDERSTANDS
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
COMMUNICATED
THE
SPEAKER
REPEATS
WHAT
SHE
SAID
EARLIER
USING
A
STRONGER
VOICE
INTONATION
AND
MORE
EX

GESTURES
THIS
ALLOWS
THE
SPEAKER
TO
REPAIR
THE
MISTAKE
AND
BE
MORE
EX
PLICIT
TO
THE
LISTENER
ALLOWING
HER
TO
UNDERSTAND

USUALLY
FROWNING
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
THE
CASE
WHEN
THE
SPEAKER
SAYS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
VAGUE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THEY
MIGHT
SAY
I
WANT
IT
TO
THEIR
PARTNER
WITHOUT
SAYING
WHAT
IT
IS
THEY

THE

MAY
REPLY
USING
A

YOU

IT
TAKING

ALSO
PROVIDES
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
THE

CLARIFICATION
OR
FOR
THE
SPEAKER
TO
DETECT
THAT
THERE
IS
A

AND
TO
INITI

THE

USUALLY
WAIT
FOR
THE

ARE

THIRDLY
WE
DO
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
OUR
OWN
INDIVIDUAL
WORK
LIKE
WRITING
PAPERS
AND
BOOKS
AND
GIVING
TALKS
YR
RIGHT
COULD
YOU
TELL
ME
ABOUT
USER
STUDIES
WHAT
THEY
ARE
AND
WHY
YOU
CONSIDER
THEM
IMPORTANT
AS
OK
USER
STUDIES
ESSENTIALLY
INVOLVE
LOOKING
AT
HOW
PEOPLE
BEHAVE
EITHER
IN
THEIR
NATURAL
HABITATS
OR
IN
THE
LABORATORY
BOTH
WITH
OLD
TECHNOLOGIES
AND
WITH
NEW
ONES
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
MANY
DIFFERENT
QUESTIONS
THAT
THESE
KINDS
OF
STUDIES
CAN
HELP
YOU
ANSWER
LET
ME
NAME
A
FEW
ONE
QUESTION
IS
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
BE
THE
POTENTIAL
USER
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
DEVICE
OR
SERVICE
THAT
YOU
ARE
THINKING
OF
DEVELOPING
A
SECOND
QUES
TION
WHICH
I
THINK
IS
KEY
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
POTENTIAL
VALUE
OF
A
PARTICULAR
PRODUCT
FOR
A
USER
ONCE
WE
KNOW
THIS
WE
CAN
THEN
ASK
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
SITUATION
OR
TASK
WHAT
FEATURES
DO
WE
WANT
TO
DELIVER
AND
HOW
BEST
SHOULD
WE
DELIVER
THOSE
FEATURES
THIS
INCLUDES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHAT
WOULD
THE
INTERFACE
LOOK
LIKE
FI
NALLY
I
THINK
USER
STUDIES
ARE
IMPORTANT
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
USERS
LIVES
MAY
CHANGE
AND
HOW
THEY
WILL
BE
AF
FECTED
BY
INTRODUCING
A
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
THIS
HAS
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
SOCIAL
PHYSICAL
AND
TECHNOLOGI
CAL
CONTEXT
INTO
WHICH
IT
WILL
BE
INTRODUCED
YR
SO
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
HAVE
A
SET
OF
GENERAL
QUESTIONS
YOU
HAVE
IN
MIND
WHEN
YOU
DO
A
USER
STUDY
COULD
YOU
NOW
DESCRIBE
HOW
YOU
WOULD
DO
A
USER
STUDY
AND
WHAT
KINDS
OF
THINGS
YOU
WOULD
BE
LOOKING
FOR
AS
WELL
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
CLASSES
OF
USER
STUDIES
AND
BOTH
ARE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
WAYS
YOU
GO
ABOUT
THEM
THERE
ARE
EVALUATION
STUDIES
WHERE
WE
TAKE
A
CONCEPT
A
PROTOTYPE
OR
EVEN
A
DEVEL
OPED
TECHNOLOGY
AND
LOOK
AT
HOW
IT
IS
USED
AND
THEN
TRY
TO
MODIFY
OR
IMPROVE
IT
BASED
ON
WHAT
WE
FIND
THE
SECOND
CLASS
OF
USER
STUDIES
IS
MORE
ABOUT
DISCOV
ERING
WHAT
PEOPLE
UNMET
NEEDS
MAY
BE
THIS
MEANS
TRYING
TO
DEVELOP
NEW
CONCEPTS
AND
IDEAS
FOR
THINGS
THAT
PEOPLE
MAY
NEVER
HAVE
THOUGHT
OF
BEFORE
THIS
IS
DIFFICULT
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
T
NECESSARILY
JUST
ASK
PEOPLE
WHAT
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
OR
WHAT
THEY
WOULD
USE
INSTEAD
YOU
HAVE
TO
MAKE
INFERENCES
FROM
STUDYING
PEOPLE
IN
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
AND
TRY
TO
UNDERSTAND
FROM
THIS
WHAT
THEY
MIGHT
NEED
OR
VALUE
YR
IN
THE
BOOK
WE
MENTION
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
TAK
ING
INTO
ACCOUNT
SOCIAL
ASPECTS
SUCH
AS
AWARENESS
OF
OTHERS
HOW
PEOPLE
COMMUNICATE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
SO
ON
DO
YOU
THINK
THESE
ISSUES
ARE
IMPORTANT
WHEN
YOU
ARE
DOING
THESE
TWO
KINDS
OF
USER
STUDIES
AS
WELL
YES
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
I
THINK
SOCIAL
ASPECTS
REALLY
ARE
PLAYING
TO
THAT
SECOND
CLASS
OF
USER
STUDY
I
MENTIONED
WHERE
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
DISCOVER
WHAT
PEOPLE
UNMET
NEEDS
OR
REQUIREMENTS
MAY
BE
HERE
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
GET
RICH
DESCRIPTIONS
ABOUT
WHAT
PEOPLE
DO
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THEIR
EVERYDAY
WHETHER
THIS
IS
IN
THEIR
WORKING
LIVES
THEIR
HOME
LIVES
OR
LIVES
ON
THE
MOVE
I
D
SAY
GETTING
THE
SOCIAL
ASPECTS
UNDERSTOOD
IS
OFTEN
VERY
IMPORTANT
IN
TRYING
TO
UNDER
STAND
WHAT
VALUE
NEW
PRODUCTS
AND
SERVICES
MIGHT
INTERVIEW
BRING
TO
PEOPLE
DAY
TO
DAY
ACTIVITIES
AND
ALSO
HOW
THEY
WOULD
FIT
INTO
THOSE
EXISTING
ACTIVITIES
YR
AND
WHAT
ABOUT
COGNITIVE
ASPECTS
SUCH
AS
HOW
PEOPLE
CARRY
OUT
THEIR
TASKS
WHAT
THEY
REMEMBER
WHAT
THEY
ARE
BAD
AT
REMEMBERING
IS
THAT
ALSO
IM
PORTANT
TO
LOOK
INTO
WHEN
YOU
ARE
DOING
THESE
KINDS
OF
STUDIES
AS
YES
IF
YOU
THINK
ABOUT
EVALUATION
STUDIES
THEN
COGNITIVE
ASPECTS
ARE
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
LOOKING
AT
COGNITIVE
ASPECTS
CAN
HELP
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
USER
INTERACTION
IN
PARTICULAR
WHAT
PROCESSES
ARE
GOING
ON
IN
THEIR
HEADS
THIS
INCLUDES
ISSUES
LIKE
LEARNING
HOW
USERS
PERCEIVE
A
DEVICE
AND
HOW
THEY
FORM
A
MENTAL
MODEL
OF
HOW
SOMETHING
WORKS
COGNI
TIVE
ISSUES
ARE
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
TO
CONSIDER
WHEN
WE
WANT
TO
CONTRAST
ONE
DEVICE
WITH
ANOTHER
OR
THINK
ABOUT
NEW
AND
BETTER
WAYS
IN
WHICH
WE
MIGHT
DESIGN
AN
INTERFACE
YR
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
COULD
DESCRIBE
TO
ME
BRIEFLY
ONE
OF
YOUR
RECENT
STUDIES
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
COG
NITIVE
AND
SOCIAL
ASPECTS
AS
HOW
ABOUT
A
RECENT
STUDY
WE
DID
TO
DO
WITH
BUILDING
DEVICES
FOR
READING
DIGITAL
DOCUMENTS
WHEN
WE
FIRST
SET
OUT
ON
THIS
STUDY
BEFORE
WE
COULD
BEGIN
TO
THINK
ABOUT
HOW
TO
BUILD
SUCH
DEVICES
WE
HAD
TO
BEGIN
BY
ASKING
WHAT
DO
WE
MEAN
BY
READING
IT
TURNED
OUT
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
LOT
WRITTEN
ABOUT
THE
DIF
FERENT
WAYS
PEOPLE
READ
IN
THEIR
DAY
TO
DAY
LIVES
SO
THE
FIRST
THING
WE
DID
WAS
A
VERY
BROAD
STUDY
LOOKING
AT
HOW
PEOPLE
READ
IN
WORK
SITUATIONS
THE
TECHNIQUE
WE
USED
HERE
WAS
A
COMBINATION
OF
ASKING
PEOPLE
TO
FILL
OUT
A
DIARY
ABOUT
THEIR
READING
ACTIVITIES
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
A
DAY
AND
INTERVIEWING
THEM
AT
THE
END
OF
EACH
DAY
THE
INTERVIEWS
WERE
BASED
AROUND
WHAT
WAS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
DIARIES
WHICH
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
GOOD
WAY
OF
UNPACKING
MORE
DETAILS
ABOUT
WHAT
PEOPLE
HAD
BEEN
DOING
THAT
INITIAL
STUDY
ALLOWED
US
TO
CATEGORIZE
ALL
THE
DIFFERENT
WAYS
PEOPLE
WERE
READING
WHAT
WE
FOUND
OUT
IS
THAT
ACTUALLY
YOU
CAN
T
TALK
ABOUT
READING
IN
A
GENERIC
SENSE
BUT
THAT
IT
FALLS
INTO
AT
LEAST
DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES
FOR
EXAMPLE
SOMETIMES
PEOPLE
SKIM
READ
SOMETIMES
THEY
READ
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
WRITING
SOMETHING
AND
SOMETIMES
THEY
READ
VERY
REFLECTIVELY
AND
DEEPLY
MARKING
UP
THEIR
DOCUMENTS
AS
THEY
GO
WHAT
QUICKLY
EMERGED
FROM
THIS
FIRST
STUDY
WAS
THAT
IF
YOU
RE
DESIGNING
A
DEVICE
FOR
READING
IT
MIGHT
LOOK
VERY
DIFFERENT
DEPENDING
ON
THE
KIND
OF
READING
THE
USERS
ARE
DOING
SO
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
THEY
RE
READING
BY
THEMSELVES
THE
SCREEN
SIZE
AND
VIEWING
ANGLE
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
IF
THEY
RE
READING
WITH
OTHERS
IF
THEY
RE
SKIM
READING
THE
ABILITY
TO
QUICKLY
FLICK
THROUGH
PAGES
IS
IMPORTANT
AND
IF
THEY
RE
READING
AND
WRITING
THEN
THIS
POINTS
TO
THE
NEED
FOR
A
BASED
INTERFACE
ALL
OF
THESE
ISSUES
BECOME
IMPORTANT
DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS
THIS
STUDY
THEN
LED
TO
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
SOME
DESIGN
CONCEPTS
AND
IDEAS
FOR
NEW
KINDS
OF
READING
DEVICES
AT
THIS
STAGE
WE
INVOLVED
DESIGNERS
TO
DE
VELOP
DIFFERENT
PROPS
TO
GET
FEEDBACK
AND
REACTIONS
FROM
POTENTIAL
USERS
A
PROP
COULD
BE
ANYTHING
FROM
A
QUICK
SKETCH
TO
AN
ANIMATION
TO
A
STYROFOAM
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
THIS
INITIAL
DESIGN
WORK
YOU
CAN
THEN
BEGIN
TO
DEVELOP
WORKING
PROTOTYPES
AND
TEST
THEM
WITH
REALISTIC
TASKS
IN
BOTH
LABORATORY
AND
NATURAL
SETTINGS
SOME
OF
THIS
WORK
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
COMPLETED
BUT
THE
PROJECT
HAS
HAD
AN
IMPACT
ON
SEV
ERAL
DIFFERENT
RESEARCH
AND
DEVELOPMENT
EFFORTS
YR
WOULD
YOU
SAY
THAT
USER
STUDIES
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
COME
AN
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THE
INTERACTION
DESIGN
PROCESS
ESPECIALLY
AS
NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
LIKE
UBIQUITOUS
COMPUTING
AND
HANDHELD
DEVICES
COME
INTO
BEING
AND
WHERE
NO
ONE
REALLY
KNOWS
WHAT
AP
PLICATIONS
TO
DEVELOP
AS
YES
I
THINK
THE
MAIN
CONTRIBUTION
OF
USER
STUD
IES
SAY
YEARS
AGO
WAS
IN
THE
AREA
OF
EVALUATION
AND
USABILITY
TESTING
I
THINK
THAT
ROLE
IS
CHANGING
NOW
IN
THAT
USER
STUDIES
RESEARCHERS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
THOSE
WHO
EVALUATE
DEVICES
AND
INTERFACES
BUT
ALSO
THOSE
WHO
DE
VELOP
NEW
CONCEPTS
ALSO
ANOTHER
IMPORTANT
DEVEL
OPMENT
IS
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
WAY
THE
RESEARCH
IS
CARRIED
OUT
MORE
AND
MORE
I
AM
FINDING
THAT
TEAMS
ARE
DRAW
ING
TOGETHER
PEOPLE
FROM
OTHER
DISCIPLINES
SUCH
AS
SO
CIOLOGISTS
MARKETING
PEOPLE
DESIGNERS
AND
PEOPLE
FROM
BUSINESS
AND
TECHNOLOGY
DEVELOPMENT
YR
SO
THEY
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
WORKING
AS
A
MULTIDISCI
PLINARY
TEAM
FINALLY
WHAT
IS
IT
LIKE
TO
WORK
IN
A
LARGE
ORGANIZATION
LIKE
HP
WITH
SO
MANY
DIFFERENT
DEPARTMENTS
AS
ONE
THING
ABOUT
WORKING
FOR
A
LARGE
ORGANIZA
TION
IS
THAT
YOU
GET
A
LOT
OF
VARIETY
IN
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
YOU
CAN
PICK
AND
CHOOSE
TO
SOME
EXTENT
AND
DE
PENDING
ON
THE
ORGANIZATION
DON
T
HAVE
TO
BE

A

ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
YOU
WORK
CHAPTER
DESIGN
FOR
COLLABORATION
AND

FOR
A
SMALLER
ORGANIZATION
SUCH
AS
A
START
UP
TEAMS
THEY
PUT
HUGE
PRESSURES
ON
YOU
BECAUSE
THEY
PANY
INEVITABLY
THERE
IS
LOTS
OF
PRESSURE
TO
GET
THINGS
HAVE
HUGE
PRESSURES
ON
THEM
YOU
REALLY
HAVE
TO
OUT
THE
DOOR
QUICKLY
THINGS
ARE
OFTEN
VERY
FOCUSED
WORK
AT
EFFECTIVELY
INCORPORATING
USER
STUDIES
FIND
WHETHER
LARGE
OR
SMALL
HOWEVER
I
THINK
ONE
OF
THE
INGS
INTO
THE
DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS
THIS
CAN
BE
IN
HARDEST
THINGS
I
HAVE
FOUND
IN
WORKING
FOR
CORPORATE
CREDIBLY
CHALLENGING
BUT
IT
ALSO
SATISFYING
TO
HAVE
RESEARCH
IS
LEARNING
TO
WORK
WITH
THE
DEVELOPMENT

IS
TO

WE
BEGIN
BY
LOOKING
IN

AT

INTERFACES
EXAMINING
THE

OF

IT

WAS

SEE
LAUREL
BEHAVIOR
ANOTHER
IMPORTANT
CONSIDERATION
IN
MAKING
VIRTUAL
CHARACTERS
BELIEVABLE
IS
HOW
CONVINCING
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
IS
WHEN
PERFORMING
ACTIONS
IN
PARTICULAR
HOW
GOOD
ARE
THEY
AT
POINTING
OUT
RELEVANT
OBJECTS
ON
THE
SCREEN
TO
THE
USER
SO
THAT
THE
USER
KNOWS
WHAT
THEY
ARE
REFERRING
TO
ONE
WAY
OF
ACHIEVING
THIS
IS
FOR
THE
VIRTUAL
CHAR
ACTER
TO
LEAD
WITH
ITS
EYES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DOG
TURNS
TO
LOOK
AT
AN
OBJECT
OR
A
PERSON
BEFORE
HE
ACTUALLY
WALKS
OVER
TO
IT
TO
PICK
THE
OBJECT
UP
OR
TO
INVITE
THE
PERSON
TO
PLAY
A
CHARACTER
THAT
DOES
NOT
LEAD
WITH

LOOKS
VERY
MECHAN
ICAL
AND
AS
SUCH
NOT
VERY
LIFE
LIKE
MAES
AS
MENTIONED
PREVIOUSLY
AN
AGENT
ACTIONS
NEED
ALSO
TO
MATCH
THEIR
UNDERLY
ING
EMOTIONAL
STATE
IF
THE
AGENT
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
ANGRY
THEN
ITS
BODY
POSTURE
MOVE
MENTS
AND
FACIAL
EXPRESSION
ALL
NEED
TO
BE
INTEGRATED
TO
SHOW
THIS
HOW
THIS
CAN
BE
ACHIEVED
EFFECTIVELY
CAN
BE
LEARNED
FROM
ANIMATORS
WHO
HAVE
A
LONG
TRADITION
IN
THIS
FIELD
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONE
OF
THEIR
TECHNIQUES
IS
TO
GREATLY
EXAGGERATE
EXPRESSIONS
AND
MOVEMENTS
AS
A
WAY
OF
CONVEYING
AND
DRAWING
ATTENTION
TO
AN
EMOTIONAL
STATE
OF
A
CHARACTER
MODE
OF
INTERACTION
THE
WAY
THE
CHARACTER
COMMUNICATES
WITH
THE
USER
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
ONE
APPROACH
HAS
BEEN
TOWARDS
EMULATING
HUMAN
CONVERSATIONS
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
THE
CHARACTER
WAY
OF
TALKING
MORE
CONVINCING
HOWEVER
AS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
DEBATE
ABOVE
A
DRAWBACK
OF
THIS
KIND
OF
MASQUERADINGIS
THAT
PEOPLE
CAN
GET
ANNOYED
EAS
ILY
AND
FEEL
CHEATED
PARADOXICALLY
A
MORE
BELIEVABLE
AND
ACCEPTABLE
DIALOG
WITH
A
VIRTUAL
CHARACTER
MAY
PROVE
TO
BE
ONE
THAT
IS
BASED
ON
A
SIMPLE
MODE
OF
IN
TERACTION
IN
WHICH
PRERECORDED
SPEECH
IS
PLAYED
AT
CERTAIN
CHOICE
POINTS
IN
THE
IN
TERACTION
AND
THE
USER
RESPONSES
ARE
LIMITED
TO
SELECTING
MENU
OPTIONS
THE
REASON
WHY
THIS
MODE
OF
INTERACTION
MAY
ULTIMATELY
PROVE
MORE
EFFECTIVE
IS
BECAUSE
THE
USER
IS
IN
A
BETTER
POSITION
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
THE
AGENT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
DOING
THERE
IS
NO
PRETENCE
OF
A
STUPID

THAT
IN

IT
IS

NECESSARY

DIFFICULT
TO

HOW
DID

PERSUADE
THE

OF

ABOUT

BLACK

AND
PAY
HIM
ROYALLY
FOR

IN

TO
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
I
NEED
TO
EXPLAIN
SOMETHING
ABOUT
BABY
GEESE
A
FEW
DECADES

THE
NATURALIST
KONRAD
LORENZ
DISCOV
ERED
THAT
GOSLINGS
UPON
BREAKING
OUT
OF
THEIR
EGGS
BECOME
ATTACHED
TO
THE
FIRST
MOVING
OBJECT
THEY
ENCOUNTER
WHICH
IS
GENERALLY
THEIR
MOTHER
LORENZ
KNEW
THIS
BECAUSE
IN
ONE
EX
PERIMENT
HE
BECAME
THE
FIRST
THING
THEY
SAW
AND
THEY
FOL
LOWED
HIM
LOYALLY
FROM
THEN
ON
THROUGH
ADOLESCENCE
WITH
THAT
LORENZ
DEMONSTRATED
NOT
ONLY
THAT
GOSLINGS
MAKE
INI
TIAL
DECISIONS
BASED
ON
WHAT
AVAILABLE
IN
THEIR
ENVIRONMENT
BUT
THAT
THEY
STICK
WITH
A
DECISION
ONCE
IT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
LORENZ
CALLED
THIS
NATURAL
PHENOMENON
IMPRINTING
IS
THE
HUMAN
BRAIN
THEN
WIRED
LIKE
THAT
OF
A
GOSLING
DO
OUR
FIRST
IMPRESSIONS
AND
DECISIONS
BECOME
IMPRINTED
AND
IF
SO
HOW
DOES
THIS
IMPRINTING
PLAY
OUT
IN
OUR
LIVES
WHEN
WE
ENCOUNTER
A
NEW
PRODUCT
FOR
INSTANCE
DO
WE
ACCEPT
THE
FIRST
PRICE
THAT
COMES
BEFORE
OUR
EYES
AND
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
DOES
THAT
PRICE
WHICH
IN
ACADEMIC
LINGO
WE
CALL
AN
ANCHOR
HAVE
A
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
ON
OUR
WILLINGNESS
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
PRODUCT
FROM
THEN
ON
IT
SEEMS
THAT
WHAT
GOOD
FOR
THE
GOOSE
IS
GOOD
FOR
HU
MANS
AS
WELL
AND
THIS
INCLUDES
ANCHORING
FROM
THE
BEGIN
NING
FOR

ASSAEL
ANCHORED
HIS
PEARLS
TO
THE
FINEST
GEMS
IN
THE

AND
THE
PRICES
FOLLOWED
FOREVER
AFTER
SIMILARLY
ONCE
WE
BUY
A
NEW
PRODUCT
AT
A
PARTICULAR
PRICE
PREDICTABLY
IRRATIONAL
WE
BECOME
ANCHORED
TO
THAT
PRICE
BUT
HOW
EXACTLY
DOES
THIS
WORK
WHY
DO
WE
ACCEPT
ANCHORS
CONSIDER
THIS
IF
I
ASKED
YOU
FOR
THE
LAST
TWO
DIGITS
OF
YOUR
SOCIAL
SECURITY
NUMBER
MINE
ARE
THEN
ASKED
YOU
WHETHER
YOU
WOULD
PAY
THIS
NUMBER
IN

FOR
ME
THIS
WOULD
BE
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
BOTTLE
OF
COTES

WOULD
THE
MERE
SUGGESTION
OF
THAT

INFLUENCE
HOW
MUCH
YOU
WOULD
BE

TO
SPEND
ON

SOUNDS
PREPOSTEROUS
DOESN
T
IT
WELL
WAIT
UNTIL
YOU
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
A

OF

TELL
US
WHETHER
THEY
WOULD
PAY
THIS
AMOUNT
FOR
A

INCLUDING
THE

THEN
WE
WOULD
ASK
THEM
TO
ACTUALLY

ON
THESE
ITEMS
IN
AN
AUCTION
WHAT
WERE
WE
TRYING
TO
PROVE
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
WHAT
WE
CALLED
ARBITRARY
COHERENCE
THE
BASIC
IDEA
OF
ARBITRARY
COHER
ENCE
IS
THIS
ALTHOUGH
INITIAL
PRICES
SUCH
AS
THE
PRICE
OF

PEARLS
ARE
ARBITRARY
ONCE
THOSE
PRICES
ARE
ESTABLISHED
IN
OUR
MINDS
THEY
WILL
SHAPE
NOT

PRESENT
PRICES
BUT
ALSO
FUTURE

THIS
MAKES
THEM
COHERENT
SO
WOULD
THINK
ING
ABOUT
ONE
SOCIAL

NUMBER
BE
ENOUGH
TO
CREATE
THE

IF

I
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MUST
BE
THINKING
I
VE
BEEN

TOO

FOR

MY

THIS
IS
NOT
THE

HOWEVER
SOCIAL

NUMBERS
WERE
THE

IN

BECAUSE
WE
REQUESTED

WE

ANY
QUESTION
IN

WOULD
HAVE
CREATED
THE

DOES
THAT

NOT
BUT
THAT
THE

WE
ARE

AFTER
ALL
T
THE

THE
HIGHEST

PAID
FOR
AN

WAS
BASED
NOT
ON

I

OF

THE

ALTHOUGH
THE
WILLINGNESS

WAS

THERE
WAS
ALSO
A

THE

OF

IS
THAT

A
CERTAIN
PRICE
FOR
ONE

THEIR
WILLINGNESS

INITIAL

LARGELY

TO

WE
DECIDED
TO

ANOTHER

ONE
IN
WHICH
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
LURE
OUR

FROM
OLD
ANCHORS
TO
NEW
ONES
FOR
THIS
EXPERIMENT
WE
ENLISTED
SOME
UNDERGRADUATE

SOME
GRADUATE

AND
SOME

WHO
HAD
COME
TO
THE

TO
RECRUIT

PREDICTABLY
IRRATIONAL
PARTICIPANTS
WITH

EACH
ASKED

A

WHICH
SERVED
AS
THE
PRICE
ANCHOR
FOR
HEAR
ING
THOSE

AGAIN
ONE
SOUND
WAS
A
SECOND
HIGH
PITCHED
HERTZ
SOUND
SOMEWHAT
LIKE
SOMEONE
SCREAMING
IN
A
HIGH
PITCHED
VOICE
ANOTHER
WAS
A
SECOND
FULL

NOISE
ALSO
CALLED
WHITE
NOISE
WHICH
IS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
NOISE
A

SET
MAKES
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
RECEPTION
THE
THIRD
WAS
A
SECOND
OSCILLATION
BETWEEN
HIGH
PITCHED
AND
LOW
PITCHED
SOUNDS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THE
BANKERS
UNDER
STOOD
EXACTLY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
ABOUT
TO
EXPERIENCE
BUT
MAYBE
EVEN
OUR
ANNOYING
SOUNDS
WERE
LESS
ANNOYING
THAN
TALKING
ABOUT
INVESTMENT
BANKING
WE
USED
SOUNDS
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
EXISTING
MARKET
FOR
AN
NOYING
SOUNDS
SO
THE
PARTICIPANTS
COULDN
T
USE
A
MARKET
PRICE
AS
A
WAY
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THE
VALUE
OF
THESE
SOUNDS
WE
ALSO
USED
ANNOYING
SOUNDS
SPECIFICALLY
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
LIKES
SUCH
SOUNDS
IF
WE
HAD
USED
CLASSICAL
MUSIC
SOME
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
IT
BETTER
THAN
OTHERS
AS
FOR
THE
SOUNDS
THEMSELVES
I
SELECTED
THEM
AFTER
CREATING
HUNDREDS
OF
SOUNDS
CHOOSING
THESE
THREE
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
IN
MY
OPINION
EQUALLY
ANNOYING
WE
PLACED
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
IN
FRONT
OF
COMPUTER
SCREENS
AT
THE
LAB
AND
HAD
THEM
CLAMP
HEADPHONES
OVER
THEIR
EARS
AS
THE

QUIETED
DOWN
THE
FIRST
GROUP
SAW
THIS

SAGE
APPEAR
IN

OF
THEM
IN
A
FEW
MOMENTS
WE
ARE
GO
ING
TO
PLAY
A
NEW
UNPLEASANT
TONE
OVER
YOUR
HEADSET
WE
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
HOW
ANNOYING
YOU
FIND
IT
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
YOU
HEAR
THE
TONE
WE
WILL
ASK
YOU
WHETHER
HYPOTHETICALLY
YOU
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
REPEAT
THE
SAME
EXPERIENCE
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
A
PAYMENT
OF
CENTS
THE
SECOND
GROUP
GOT
THE
SAME
MESSAGE
ONLY
WITH
AN
OFFER
OF
CENTS
RATHER
THAN
CENTS
WOULD
THE
ANCHOR
PRICES
MAKE
A

TO
FIND
OUT
WE
TURNED
ON
THE
SOUND
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
IRRITATING
SECOND
HERTZ
SQUEAL
SOME
OF
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
GRIMACED
OTH
ERS
ROLLED
THEIR

WHEN
THE
SCREECHING
ENDED
EACH
PARTICIPANT
WAS
PRE

WITH
THE
ANCHORING
QUESTION
PHRASED
AS
A
HYPOTHETI

CHOICE
WOULD
THE
PARTICIPANT
BE
WILLING
HYPOTHETICALLY
TO
REPEAT
THE
EXPERIENCE
FOR
A
CASH
PAYMENT
WHICH
WAS
CENTS
FOR
THE
FIRST
GROUP
AND
CENTS
FOR
THE
SECOND
GROUP
AFTER
ANSWERING
THIS
ANCHORING
QUESTION
THE
PARTICIPANTS
WERE
ASKED
TO
INDICATE
ON
THE
COMPUTER
SCREEN
THE
LOWEST
PRICE
THEY
WOULD
DEMAND
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
SOUND
AGAIN
THIS
DECISION
WAS
REAL
BY
THE
WAY
AS
IT
WOULD
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THEY
WOULD
HEAR
THE
SOUND
AGAIN
AND
GET
PAID
FOR
DOING
SO
SOON
AFTER
THE
PARTICIPANTS
ENTERED
THEIR
PRICES
THEY
LEARNED
THE
OUTCOME
PARTICIPANTS
WHOSE
PRICE
WAS
SUFFI
CIENTLY
LOW
WON
THE
SOUND
HAD
THE
UNPLEASANT
OPPORTU
NITY
TO
HEAR
IT
AGAIN
AND
GOT
PAID
FOR
DOING
SO
THE
PARTICIPANTS
WHOSE
PRICE
WAS
TOO
HIGH
DID
NOT
LISTEN
TO
THE
SOUND
AND
WERE
NOT
PAID
FOR
THIS
PART
OF
THE
EXPERIMENT
WHAT
WAS
THE
POINT
OF
ALL
THIS
WE
WANTED
TO
FIND
OUT
WHETHER
THE
FIRST
PRICES
THAT
WE
SUGGESTED
CENTS
AND
CENTS
HAD
SERVED
AS
AN
ANCHOR
AND
INDEED
THEY
HAD
THOSE
WHO
FIRST
FACED
THE
HYPOTHETICAL
DECISION
ABOUT
WHETHER
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
SOUND
FOR
CENTS
NEEDED
MUCH
LESS
MONEY
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
THIS
SOUND
AGAIN
CENTS
ON
AVERAGE
RELATIVE
TO
THOSE
WHO
FIRST
FACED
THE
HYPOTHETICAL
DECISION
ABOUT
WHETHER
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
SOUND
FOR
CENTS
THIS
SEC
OND
GROUP
DEMANDED
MORE
THAN
TWICE
THE
COMPENSATION
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
BIDS
WE
GOT
WERE
INDEED
THE
LOWEST
PRICES
FOR
WHICH
THE
PARTICIPANTS
WOULD
LISTEN
TO
THE
ANNOYING
SOUNDS
WE
USED
THE
BECKER
DEGROOT
MARSCHAK
PROCEDURE
THIS
IS
AN
AUCTION
LIKE
PROCEDURE
IN
WHICH
EACH
OF
THE
PARTICIPANTS
BIDS
AGAINST
A
PRICE
RANDOMLY
DRAWN
BY
A
COMPUTER
CENTS
ON
AVERAGE
FOR
THE
SAME
ANNOYING
EXPERIENCE
DO
YOU
SEE
THE
DIFFERENCE
THAT
THE
SUGGESTED
PRICE
HAD
BUT
THIS
WAS
ONLY
THE
START
OF
OUR
EXPLORATION
WE
ALSO
WANTED
TO
KNOW
HOW
INFLUENTIAL
THE
ANCHOR
WOULD
BE
IN
FU
TURE
DECISIONS
SUPPOSE
WE
GAVE
THE
PARTICIPANTS
AN
OPPORTU
NITY
TO
DROP
THIS
ANCHOR
AND
RUN
FOR
ANOTHER
WOULD
THEY
DO
IT
TO
PUT
IT
IN
TERMS
OF
GOSLINGS
WOULD
THEY
SWIM
ACROSS
THE
POND
AFTER
THEIR
ORIGINAL
IMPRINT
AND
THEN
MIDWAY
SWING
THEIR
ALLEGIANCE
TO
A
NEW
MOTHER
GOOSE
IN
TERMS
OF
GOSLINGS
I
THINK
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THEY
WOULD
STICK
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL
MOM
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
HUMANS
THE
NEXT
TWO
PHASES
OF
THE
EXPERIMENT
WOULD
ENABLE
US
TO
ANSWER
THESE
QUESTIONS
IN
THE
SECOND
PHASE
OF
THE
EXPERIMENT
WE
TOOK
PARTICI
PANTS
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
CENTS
AND
CENTS
GROUPS
AND
TREATED
THEM
TO
SECONDS
OF
A
WHITE
WOOSHING
NOISE
HY
POTHETICALLY
WOULD
YOU
LISTEN
TO
THIS
SOUND
AGAIN
FOR
CENTS
WE
ASKED
THEM
AT
THE
END
THE
RESPONDENTS
PRESSED
A
BUTTON
ON
THEIR
COMPUTERS
TO
INDICATE
YES
OR
NO
OK
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
YOU
NEED
TO
BE
PAID
FOR
THIS
WE
ASKED
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
TYPED
IN
THEIR
LOWEST
PRICE
THE
COM
PUTER
DID
ITS
THING
AND
DEPENDING
ON
THEIR
BIDS
SOME
PARTICI
PANTS
LISTENED
TO
THE
SOUND
AGAIN
AND
GOT
PAID
AND
SOME
DID
NOT
WHEN
WE
COMPARED
THE
PRICES
THE
CENTS
GROUP
OFFERED
MUCH
LOWER
BIDS
THAN
THE
CENTS
GROUP
THIS
MEANS
THAT
AL
THOUGH
BOTH
GROUPS
HAD
BEEN
EQUALLY
EXPOSED
TO
THE
SUGGESTED
CENTS
AS
THEIR
FOCAL
ANCHORING
RESPONSE
TO
HYPOTHETI
CALLY
WOULD
YOU
LISTEN
TO
THIS
SOUND
AGAIN
FOR
CENTS
THE
FIRST
ANCHOR
IN
THIS
ANNOYING
SOUND
CATEGORY
WHICH
WAS
CENTS
FOR
SOME
AND
CENTS
FOR
OTHERS
PREDOMINATED
WHY
PERHAPS
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
CENTS
GROUP
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
FOLLOWING
TO
THEMSELVES
WELL
I
LISTENED
PREVIOUSLY
TO
THAT
ANNOYING
SOUND
FOR
A
LOW
AMOUNT
THIS
SOUND
IS
NOT
MUCH
DIFFERENT
SO
IF
I
SAID
A
LOW
AMOUNT
FOR
THE
PREVIOUS
ONE
I
GUESS
I
COULD
BEAR
THIS
SOUND
FOR
ABOUT
THE
SAME
PRICE
THOSE
WHO
WERE
IN
THE
CENTS
GROUP
USED
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
LOGIC
BUT
BECAUSE
THEIR
STARTING
POINT
WAS
DIF
FERENT
SO
WAS
THEIR
ENDING
POINT
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
TOLD
THEMSELVES
WELL
I
LISTENED
PREVIOUSLY
TO
THAT
ANNOYING
SOUND
FOR
A
HIGH
AMOUNT
THIS
SOUND
IS
NOT
MUCH
DIFFERENT
SO
SINCE
I
SAID
A
HIGH
AMOUNT
FOR
THE
PREVIOUS
ONE
I
GUESS
I
COULD
BEAR
THIS
SOUND
FOR
ABOUT
THE
SAME
PRICE
INDEED
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
FIRST
ANCHOR
HELD
INDICATING
THAT
ANCHORS
HAVE
AN
ENDURING
EFFECT
FOR
PRESENT
PRICES
AS
WELL
AS
FOR
FUTURE
PNCES
THERE
WAS
ONE
MORE
STEP
TO
THIS
EXPERIMENT
THIS
TIME
WE
HAD
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
LISTEN
TO
THE
OSCILLATING
SOUND
THAT
ROSE
AND
FELL
IN
PITCH
FOR
SECONDS
WE
ASKED
OUR
CENTS
GROUP
HYPOTHETICALLY
WOULD
YOU
LISTEN
TO
THIS
SOUND
AGAIN
FOR
CENTS
THEN
WE
ASKED
OUR
CENTS
GROUP
WOULD
YOU
LIS
TEN
TO
THIS
SOUND
AGAIN
FOR
CENTS
HAVING
FLIPPED
OUR
ANCHORS
WE
WOULD
NOW
SEE
WHICH
ONE
THE
LOCAL
ANCHOR
OR
THE
FIRST
ANCHOR
EXERTED
THE
GREATEST
INFLUENCE
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
PARTICIPANTS
TYPED
IN
YES
OR
NO
THEN
WE
ASKED
THEM
FOR
REAL
BIDS
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
TAKE
FOR
YOU
TO
LISTEN
TO
THIS
AGAIN
AT
THIS
POINT
THEY
HAD
A
HISTORY
WITH
THREE
ANCHORS
THE
FIRST
ONE
THEY
ENCOUNTERED
IN
THE
EXPERI

EITHER
CENTS
OR
CENTS
THE
SECOND
ONE
CENTS
AND
THE
MOST
RECENT
ONE
EITHER
CENTS
OR
CENTS
WHICH
ONE
OF
THESE
WOULD
HAVE
THE
LARGEST
INFLUENCE
ON
THE
PRICE
THEY
DEMANDED
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
SOUND
AGAIN
IT
WAS
AS
IF
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
MINDS
TOLD
THEM
IF
I
LISTENED
TO
THE
FIRST
SOUND
FOR
X
CENTS
AND
LISTENED
TO
THE
SECOND
SOUND
FOR
X
CENTS
AS
WELL
THEN
I
CAN
SURELY
DO
THIS
ONE
FOR
X
CENTS
TOO
AND
THAT
WHAT
THEY
DID
THOSE
WHO
HAD
FIRST
ENCOUNTERED
THE
CENT
ANCHOR
ACCEPTED
LOW
PRICES
EVEN
AFTER
CENTS
WAS
SUGGESTED
AS
THE
ANCHOR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THOSE
WHO
HAD
FIRST
ENCOUNTERED
THE
CENT
ANCHOR
KEPT
ON
DEMANDING
MUCH
HIGHER
PRICES
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
AN
CHORS
THAT
FOLLOWED
WHAT
DID
WE
SHOW
THAT
OUR
FIRST
DECISIONS
RESONATE
OVER
A
LONG
SEQUENCE
OF
DECISIONS
FIRST
IMPRESSIONS
ARE
IMPORTANT
WHETHER
THEY
INVOLVE
REMEMBERING
THAT
OUR
FIRST
DVD
PLAYER
COST
MUCH
MORE
THAN
SUCH
PLAYERS
COST
TODAY
AND
REALIZING
THAT
IN
COMPARISON
THE
CURRENT
PRICES
ARE
A
STEAL
OR
REMEM
BERING
THAT
GAS
WAS
ONCE
A
DOLLAR
A
GALLON
WHICH
MAKES
EV
ERY
TRIP
TO
THE
GAS
STATION
A
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE
IN
ALL
THESE
CASES
THE
RANDOM
AND
NOT
SO
RANDOM
ANCHORS
THAT
WE
EN
COUNTERED
ALONG
THE
WAY
AND
WERE
SWAYED
BY
REMAIN
WITH
US
LONG
AFTER
THE
INITIAL
DECISION
ITSELF
NOW
THAT
WE
KNOW
WE
BEHAVE
LIKE
GOSLINGS
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROCESS
BY
WHICH
OUR
FIRST
DECISIONS
TRANS
LATE
INTO
LONG
TERM
HABITS
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THIS
PROCESS
CONSIDER
THIS
EXAMPLE
YOU
RE
WALKING
PAST
A
RESTAURANT
AND
YOU
SEE
TWO
PEOPLE
STANDING
IN
LINE
WAITING
TO
GET
IN
THIS
MUST
BE
A
GOOD
RESTAURANT
YOU
THINK
TO
YOURSELF
PEOPLE
ARE
STAND
ING
IN
LINE
SO
YOU
STAND
BEHIND
THESE
PEOPLE
ANOTHER
PER
SON
WALKS
BY
HE
SEES
THREE
PEOPLE
STANDING
IN
LINE
AND
THINKS
THIS
MUST
BE
A
FANTASTIC
RESTAURANT
AND
JOINS
THE
LINE
OTHERS
JOIN
WE
CALL
THIS
TYPE
OF
BEHAVIOR
HERDING
IT
HAPPENS
WHEN
WE
ASSUME
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
GOOD
OR
BAD
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
PREVIOUS
BEHAVIOR
AND
OUR
OWN
ACTIONS
FOLLOW
SUIT
BUT
THERE
ALSO
ANOTHER
KIND
OF
HERDING
ONE
THAT
WE
CALL
SELF
HERDING
THIS
HAPPENS
WHEN
WE
BELIEVE
SOMETHING
IS
GOOD
OR
BAD
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
OUR
OWN
PREVIOUS
BEHAVIOR
ES
SENTIALLY
ONCE
WE
BECOME
THE
FIRST
PERSON
IN
LINE
AT
THE
RES
TAURANT
WE
BEGIN
TO
LINE
UP
BEHIND
OURSELF
IN
SUBSEQUENT
EXPERIENCES
DOES
THAT
MAKE
SENSE
LET
ME
EXPLAIN
RECALL
YOUR
FIRST
INTRODUCTION
TO
STARBUCKS
PERHAPS
SEV
ERAL
YEARS
AGO
I
ASSUME
THAT
NEARLY
EVERYONE
HAS
HAD
THIS
EXPERIENCE
SINCE
STARBUCKS
SITS
ON
EVERY
CORNER
IN
AMERICA
YOU
ARE
SLEEPY
AND
IN
DESPERATE
NEED
OF
A
LIQUID
ENERGY
BOOST
AS
YOU
EMBARK
ON
AN
ERRAND
ONE
AFTERNOON
YOU
GLANCE
THROUGH
THE
WINDOWS
AT
STARBUCKS
AND
WALK
IN
THE
PRICES
OF
THE
COFFEE
ARE
A
SHOCK
YOU
VE
BEEN
BLISSFULLY
DRINKING
THE
BREW
AT
DUNKIN
DONUTS
FOR
YEARS
BUT
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
WALKED
IN
AND
ARE
NOW
CURIOUS
ABOUT
WHAT
COFFEE
AT
THIS
PRICE
MIGHT
TASTE
LIKE
YOU
SURPRISE
YOURSELF
YOU
BUY
A
SMALL
COFFEE
ENJOY
ITS
TASTE
AND
ITS
EFFECT
ON
YOU
AND
WALK
OUT
THE
FOLLOWING
WEEK
YOU
WALK
BY
STARBUCKS
AGAIN
SHOULD
YOU
GO
IN
THE
IDEAL
DECISION
MAKING
PROCESS
SHOULD
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
COFFEE
STARBUCKS
VERSUS
DUNKIN
DONUTS
THE
PRICES
AT
THE
TWO
PLACES
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
COST
OR
VALUE
OF
WALKING
A
FEW
MORE
BLOCKS
TO
GET
TO
DUNKIN
DONUTS
THIS
IS
A
COMPLEX
COMPUTATION
SO
INSTEAD
YOU
RESORT
TO
THE
SIMPLE
APPROACH
I
WENT
TO
STARBUCKS
BE
FORE
AND
I
ENJOYED
MYSELF
AND
THE
COFFEE
SO
THIS
MUST
BE
A
GOOD
DECISION
FOR
ME
SO
YOU
WALK
IN
AND
GET
ANOTHER
SMALL
CUP
OF
COFFEE
IN
DOING
SO
YOU
JUST
BECAME
THE
SECOND
PERSON
IN
LINE
STANDING
BEHIND
YOURSELF
A
FEW
DAYS
LATER
YOU
AGAIN
WALK
BY
STARBUCKS
AND
THIS
TIME
YOU
VIVIDLY
REMEMBER
YOUR
PAST
DECISIONS
AND
ACT
ON
THEM
AGAIN
VOILA
YOU
BECOME
THE
THIRD
PERSON
IN
LINE
STANDING
BEHIND
YOURSELF
AS
THE
WEEKS
PASS
YOU
ENTER
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
AND
EVERY
TIME
YOU
FEEL
MORE
STRONGLY
THAT
YOU
ARE
ACTING
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
YOUR
PREFERENCES
BUYING
COFFEE
AT
STARBUCKS
HAS
BECOME
A
HABIT
WITH
YOU
BUR
THE
STORY
DOESN
T
END
THERE
NOW
THAT
YOU
HAVE
GOTTEN
USED
TO
PAYING
MORE
FOR
COFFEE
AND
HAVE
BUMPED
YOURSELF
UP
ONTO
A
NEW
CURVE
OF
CONSUMPTION
OTHER
CHANGES
ALSO
BECOME
SIMPLER
PERHAPS
YOU
WILL
NOW
MOVE
UP
FROM
THE
SMALL
CUP
FOR
TO
THE
MEDIUM
SIZE
FOR
OR
TO
THE
VENTI
FOR
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
DON
T
KNOW
HOW
YOU
GOT
INTO
THIS
PRICE
BRACKET
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
MOVING
TO
A
LARGER
COFFEE
AT
A
RELA
TIVELY
GREATER
PRICE
SEEMS
PRETTY
LOGICAL
SO
IS
A
LATERAL
MOVE
TO
OTHER
OFFERINGS
AT
STARBUCKS
CAFFE
AMERICANO
CAFFE
MISTO
MACCHIATO
AND
FRAPPUCCINO
FOR
INSTANCE
IF
YOU
STOPPED
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
CLEAR
WHETHER
YOU
SHOULD
BE
SPENDING
ALL
THIS
MONEY
ON
COFFEE
AT
STARBUCKS
INSTEAD
OF
GETTING
CHEAPER
COFFEE
AT
DUNKIN
DO
NUTS
OR
EVEN
FREE
COFFEE
AT
THE
OFFICE
BUT
YOU
DON
T
THINK
ABOUT
THESE
TRADE
OFFS
ANYMORE
YOU
VE
ALREADY
MADE
THIS
DECISION
MANY
TIMES
IN
THE
PAST
SO
YOU
NOW
ASSUME
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEND
YOUR
MONEY
YOU
VE
HERDED
YOURSELF
LINING
UP
BEHIND
YOUR
INITIAL
EXPERIENCE
AT
STARBUCKS
AND
NOW
YOU
RE
PART
OF
THE
CROWD
HOWEVER
THERE
SOMETHING
ODD
IN
THIS
STORY
IF
ANCHOR
ING
IS
BASED
ON
OUR
INITIAL
DECISIONS
HOW
DID
STARBUCKS
MAN
AGE
TO
BECOME
AN
INITIAL
DECISION
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
WE
WERE
PREVIOUSLY
ANCHORED
TO
THE
PRICES
AT
DUNKIN
DONUTS
HOW
DID
WE
MOVE
OUR
ANCHOR
TO
STARBUCKS
THIS
IS
WHERE
IT
GETS
REALLY
INTERESTING
WHEN
HOWARD
SHULTZ
CREATED
STARBUCKS
HE
WAS
AS
INTUITIVE
A
BUSINESSMAN
AS
SALVADOR
ASSAEL
HE
WORKED
DILIGENTLY
TO
SEPARATE
STARBUCKS
FROM
OTHER
COFFEE
SHOPS
NOT
THROUGH
PRICE
BUT
THROUGH
AMBIENCE
ACCORDINGLY
HE
DESIGNED
STARBUCKS
FROM
THE
VERY
BEGINNING
TO
FEEL
LIKE
A
CONTINENTAL
COFFEEHOUSE
THE
EARLY
SHOPS
WERE
FRAGRANT
WITH
THE
SMELL
OF
ROASTED
BEANS
AND
BETTER
QUALITY
ROASTED
BEANS
THAN
THOSE
AT
DUNKIN
DONUTS
THEY
SOLD
FANCY
FRENCH
COFFEE
PRESSES
THE
SHOW
CASES
PRESENTED
ALLURING
SNACKS
ALMOND
CROISSANTS
BISCOTTI
RASPBERRY
CUSTARD
PASTRIES
AND
OTHERS
WHEREAS
DUNKIN
DO
NUTS
HAD
SMALL
MEDIUM
AND
LARGE
COFFEES
STARBUCKS
OFFERED
SHORT
TALL
GRANDE
AND
VENTI
AS
WELL
AS
DRINKS
WITH
HIGH
PEDIGREE
NAMES
LIKE
CAFFE
AMERICANO
CAFFE
MISTO
MACCHI
ATO
AND
FRAPPUCCINO
STARBUCKS
DID
EVERYTHING
IN
ITS
POWER
IN
OTHER
WORDS
TO
MAKE
THE
EXPERIENCE
FEEL
DIFFERENT
SO
DIF
FERENT
THAT
WE
WOULD
NOT
USE
THE
PRICES
AT
DUNKIN
DONUTS
AS
AN
ANCHOR
BUT
INSTEAD
WOULD
BE
OPEN
TO
THE
NEW
ANCHOR
THAT
STARBUCKS
WAS
PREPARING
FOR
US
AND
THAT
TO
A
GREAT
EXTENT
IS
HOW
STARBUCKS
SUCCEEDED
GEORGE
DRAZEN
AND
I
WERE
SO
EXCITED
WITH
THE
EXPERI
MENTS
ON
COHERENT
ARBITRARINESS
THAT
WE
DECIDED
TO
PUSH
THE
IDEA
ONE
STEP
FARTHER
THIS
TIME
WE
HAD
A
DIFFERENT
TWIST
TO
EXPLORE
DO
YOU
REMEMBER
THE
FAMOUS
EPISODE
IN
THE
ADVENTURES
OF
TOM
SAWYER
THE
ONE
IN
WHICH
TOM
TURNED
THE
WHITEWASH
ING
OF
AUNT
POLLY
FENCE
INTO
AN
EXERCISE
IN
MANIPULATING
HIS
FRIENDS
AS
I
M
SURE
YOU
RECALL
TOM
APPLIED
THE
PAINT
WITH
GUSTO
PRETENDING
TO
ENJOY
THE
JOB
DO
YOU
CALL
THIS
WORK
TOM
TOLD
HIS
FRIENDS
DOES
A
BOY
GET
A
CHANCE
TO
WHITEWASH
A
FENCE
EVERY
DAY
ARMED
WITH
THIS
NEW
INFORMATION
HIS
FRIENDS
DISCOVERED
THE
JOYS
OF
WHITEWASHING
A
FENCE
BEFORE
LONG
TOM
FRIENDS
WERE
NOT
ONLY
PAYING
HIM
FOR
THE
PRIVI
LEGE
BUT
DERIVING
REAL
PLEASURE
FROM
THE
TASK
A
WIN
WIN
OUTCOME
IF
THERE
EVER
WAS
ONE
FROM
OUR
PERSPECTIVE
TOM
TRANSFORMED
A
NEGATIVE
EXPE
RIENCE
TO
A
POSITIVE
ONE
HE
TRANSFORMED
A
SITUATION
IN
WHICH
COMPENSATION
WAS
REQUIRED
TO
ONE
IN
WHICH
PEOPLE
TOM
FRIENDS
WOULD
PAY
TO
GET
IN
ON
THE
FUN
COULD
WE
DO
THE
SAME
WE
THOUGHT
WE
D
GIVE
IT
A
TRY
ONE
DAY
TO
THE
SURPRISE
OF
MY
STUDENTS
I
OPENED
THE
DAY
LECTURE
ON
MANAGERIAL
PSYCHOLOGY
WITH
A
POETRY
SELECTION
A
FEW
LINES
OF
WHOEVER
YOU
ARE
HOLDING
ME
NOW
IN
HAND
FROM
WALT
WHITMAN
LEAVES
OF
GRASS
WHOEVER
YOU
ARE
HOLDING
ME
NOW
IN
HAND
WITHOUT
ONE
THING
ALL
WILL
BE
USELESS
I
GIVE
YOU
FAIR
WARNING
BEFORE
YOU
ATTEMPT
ME
FURTHER
I
AM
NOT
WHAT
YOU
SUPPOSED
BUT
FAR
DIFFERENT
WHO
IS
HE
THAT
WOULD
BECOME
MY
FOLLOWER
WHO
WOULD
SIGN
HIMSELF
A
CANDIDATE
FOR
MY
AFFECTIONS
THE
WAY
IS
SUSPICIOUS
THE
RESULT
UNCERTAIN
PERHAPS
DESTRUCTIVE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
ALL
ELSE
I
ALONE
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
BE
YOUR
SOLE
AND
EXCLUSIVE
STANDARD
YOUR
NOVITIATE
WOULD
EVEN
THEN
BE
LONG
AND
EXHAUSTING
THE
WHOLE
PAST
THEORY
OF
YOUR
LIFE
AND
ALL
CONFORMITY
TO
THE
LIVES
AROUND
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
ABANDON
D
THEREFORE
RELEASE
ME
NOW
BEFORE
TROUBLING
YOURSELF
ANY
FURTHER
LET
GO
YOUR
HAND
FROM
MY
SHOULDERS
PUT
ME
DOWN
AND
DEPART
ON
YOUR
WAY
AFTER
CLOSING
THE
BOOK
I
TOLD
THE
STUDENTS
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
CONDUCTING
THREE
READINGS
FROM
WALT
WHITMAN
LEAVES
OF
GRASS
THAT
FRIDAY
EVENING
ONE
SHORT
ONE
MEDIUM
AND
ONE
LONG
OWING
TO
LIMITED
SPACE
I
TOLD
THEM
I
HAD
DECIDED
TO
HOLD
AN
AUCTION
TO
DETERMINE
WHO
COULD
ATTEND
I
PASSED
OUT
SHEETS
OF
PAPER
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
BID
FOR
A
SPACE
BUT
BEFORE
THEY
DID
SO
I
HAD
A
QUESTION
TO
ASK
THEM
I
ASKED
HALF
THE
STUDENTS
TO
WRITE
DOWN
WHETHER
HYPO
THETICALLY
THEY
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
PAY
ME
FOR
A
MINUTE
POETRY
RECITATION
I
ASKED
THE
OTHER
HALF
TO
WRITE
DOWN
WHETHER
HYPOTHETICALLY
THEY
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
ME
RECITE
POETRY
FOR
TEN
MINUTES
IF
I
PAID
THEM
THIS
OF
COURSE
SERVED
AS
THE
ANCHOR
NOW
I
ASKED
THE
STUDENTS
TO
BID
FOR
A
SPOT
AT
MY
POETRY
READING
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
INITIAL
ANCHOR
INFLUENCED
THE
ENSUING
BIDS
BEFORE
I
TELL
YOU
CONSIDER
TWO
THINGS
FIRST
MY
SKILLS
AT
READING
POETRY
ARE
NOT
OF
THE
FIRST
ORDER
SO
ASKING
SOMEONE
TO
PAY
ME
FOR
MINUTES
OF
IT
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
A
STRETCH
SECOND
EVEN
THOUGH
I
ASKED
HALF
OF
THE
STUDENTS
IF
THEY
WOULD
PAY
ME
FOR
THE
PRIVILEGE
OF
ATTENDING
THE
RECITATION
THEY
DIDN
T
HAVE
TO
BID
THAT
WAY
THEY
COULD
HAVE
TURNED
THE
TABLES
COMPLETELY
AND
DEMANDED
THAT
I
PAY
THEM
AND
NOW
TO
THE
RESULTS
DRUMROLL
PLEASE
THOSE
WHO
AN
SWERED
THE
HYPOTHETICAL
QUESTION
ABOUT
PAYING
ME
WERE
INDEED
WILLING
TO
PAY
ME
FOR
THE
PRIVILEGE
THEY
OFFERED
ON
AVERAGE
TO
PAY
ME
ABOUT
A
DOLLAR
FOR
THE
SHORT
POETRY
READING
ABOUT
TWO
DOLLARS
FOR
THE
MEDIUM
POETRY
READING
AND
A
BIT
MORE
THAN
THREE
DOLLARS
FOR
THE
LONG
POETRY
READING
MAYBE
I
COULD
MAKE
A
LIVING
OUTSIDE
ACADEME
AFTER
ALL
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
THOSE
WHO
WERE
ANCHORED
TO
THE
THOUGHT
OF
BEING
PAID
RATHER
THAN
PAYING
ME
AS
YOU
MIGHT
EXPECT
THEY
DEMANDED
PAYMENT
ON
AVERAGE
THEY
WANTED
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
SHORT
POETRY
READING
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
ME
DIUM
POETRY
READING
AND
TO
ENDURE
THE
LONG
POETRY
READING
MUCH
LIKE
TOM
SAWYER
THEN
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
TAKE
AN
AMBIG
UOUS
EXPERIENCE
AND
IF
YOU
COULD
HEAR
ME
RECITE
POETRY
YOU
WOULD
UNDERSTAND
JUST
HOW
AMBIGUOUS
THIS
EXPERIENCE
IS
AND
ARBITRARILY
MAKE
IT
INTO
A
PLEASURABLE
OR
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE
NEITHER
GROUP
OF
STUDENTS
KNEW
WHETHER
MY
POETRY
READING
WAS
OF
THE
QUALITY
THAT
IS
WORTH
PAYING
FOR
OR
OF
THE
QUALITY
THAT
IS
WORTH
LISTENING
TO
ONLY
IF
ONE
IS
BEING
FINANCIALLY
COM
PENSATED
FOR
THE
EXPERIENCE
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
IF
IT
IS
PLEASUR
ABLE
OR
PAINFUL
BUT
ONCE
THE
FIRST
IMPRESSION
HAD
BEEN
FORMED
THAT
THEY
WOULD
PAY
ME
OR
THAT
I
WOULD
PAY
THEM
THE
DIE
WAS
CAST
AND
THE
ANCHOR
SET
MOREOVER
ONCE
THE
FIRST
DECISION
HAD
BEEN
MADE
OTHER
DECISIONS
FOLLOWED
IN
WHAT
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
LOGICAL
AND
COHERENT
MANNER
THE
STUDENTS
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
LISTENING
TO
ME
RECITE
POETRY
WAS
A
GOOD
OR
BAD
EXPE
RIENCE
BUT
WHATEVER
THEIR
FIRST
DECISION
WAS
THEY
USED
IT
AS
INPUT
FOR
THEIR
SUBSEQUENT
DECISIONS
AND
PROVIDED
A
COHERENT
PATTERN
OF
RESPONSES
ACROSS
THE
THREE
POETRY
READINGS
OF
COURSE
MARK
TWAIN
CAME
TO
THE
SAME
CONCLUSIONS
IF
TOM
HAD
BEEN
A
GREAT
AND
WISE
PHILOSOPHER
LIKE
THE
WRITER
OF
THIS
BOOK
HE
WOULD
NOW
HAVE
COMPREHENDED
THAT
WORK
CON
SISTS
OF
WHATEVER
A
BODY
IS
OBLIGED
TO
DO
AND
THAT
PLAY
CON
SISTS
OF
WHATEVER
A
BODY
IS
NOT
OBLIGED
TO
DO
MARK
TWAIN
FURTHER
OBSERVED
THERE
ARE
WEALTHY
GENTLEMEN
IN
ENGLAND
WHO
DRIVE
FOUR
HORSE
PASSENGER
COACHES
TWENTY
OR
THIRTY
MILES
ON
A
DAILY
LINE
IN
THE
SUMMER
BECAUSE
THE
PRIVILEGE
COSTS
THEM
CONSIDERABLE
MONEY
BUT
IF
THEY
WERE
OFFERED
WAGES
FOR
THE
SERVICE
THAT
WOULD
TURN
IT
INTO
WORK
AND
THEN
THEY
WOULD
RESIGN
WHERE
DO
THESE
THOUGHTS
LEAD
US
FOR
ONE
THEY
ILLUSTRATE
THE
MANY
CHOICES
WE
MAKE
FROM
THE
TRIVIAL
TO
THE
PROFOUND
IN
WHICH
ANCHORING
PLAYS
A
ROLE
WE
DECIDE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
PURCHASE
BIG
MACS
SMOKE
RUN
RED
LIGHTS
TAKE
VACATIONS
IN
PATAGONIA
LISTEN
TO
TCHAIKOVSKY
SLAVE
AWAY
AT
DOCTORAL
DIS
SERTATIONS
MARRY
HAVE
CHILDREN
LIVE
IN
THE
SUBURBS
VOTE
REPUBLICAN
AND
SO
ON
ACCORDING
TO
ECONOMIC
THEORY
WE
BASE
THESE
DECISIONS
ON
OUR
FUNDAMENTAL
VALUES
OUR
LIKES
AND
DISLIKES
BUT
WHAT
ARE
THE
MAIN
LESSONS
FROM
THESE
EXPERIMENTS
ABOUT
OUR
LIVES
IN
GENERAL
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THE
LIVES
WE
HAVE
SO
CAREFULLY
CRAFTED
ARE
LARGELY
JUST
A
PRODUCT
OF
ARBITRARY
CO
HERENCE
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
WE
MADE
ARBITRARY
DECISIONS
AT
SOME
POINT
IN
THE
PAST
LIKE
THE
GOSLINGS
THAT
ADOPTED
LORENZ
AS
THEIR
PARENT
AND
HAVE
BUILT
OUR
LIVES
ON
THEM
EVER
SINCE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
DECISIONS
WERE
WISE
IS
THAT
HOW
WE
CHOSE
OUR
CAREERS
OUR
SPOUSES
THE
CLOTHES
WE
WEAR
AND
THE
WAY
WE
STYLE
OUR
HAIR
WERE
THEY
SMART
DECISIONS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
OR
WERE
THEY
PARTIALLY
RANDOM
FIRST
IMPRINTS
THAT
HAVE
RUN
WILD
DESCARTES
SAID
COGITO
ERGO
SUM
I
THINK
THEREFORE
I
AM
BUT
SUPPOSE
WE
ARE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
THE
SUM
OF
OUR
FIRST
NAIVE
RANDOM
BEHAVIORS
WHAT
THEN
THESE
QUESTIONS
MAY
BE
TOUGH
NUTS
TO
CRACK
BUT
IN
TERMS
OF
OUR
PERSONAL
LIVES
WE
CAN
ACTIVELY
IMPROVE
ON
OUR
IRRATIONAL
WE
WILL
RETURN
TO
THIS
ASTUTE
OBSERVATION
IN
THE
CHAPTER
ON
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
CHAPTER
BEHAVIORS
WE
CAN
START
BY
BECOMING
AWARE
OF
OUR
VULNERA
BILITIES
SUPPOSE
YOU
RE
PLANNING
TO
BUY
A
CUTTING
EDGE
CELL
PHONE
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
THREE
MEGAPIXEL
ZOOM
DIGITAL
CAMERA
OR
EVEN
A
DAILY
CUP
OF
GOURMET
COFFEE
YOU
MIGHT
BEGIN
BY
QUESTIONING
THAT
HABIT
HOW
DID
IT
BEGIN
SECOND
ASK
YOURSELF
WHAT
AMOUNT
OF
PLEASURE
YOU
WILL
BE
GETTING
OUT
OF
IT
IS
THE
PLEASURE
AS
MUCH
AS
YOU
THOUGHT
YOU
WOULD
GET
COULD
YOU
CUT
BACK
A
LITTLE
AND
BETTER
SPEND
THE
REMAINING
MONEY
ON
SOMETHING
ELSE
WITH
EVERYTHING
YOU
DO
IN
FACT
YOU
SHOULD
TRAIN
YOURSELF
TO
QUESTION
YOUR
REPEATED
BEHAV
IORS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
CELL
PHONE
COULD
YOU
TAKE
A
STEP
BACK
FROM
THE
CUTTING
EDGE
REDUCE
YOUR
OUTLAY
AND
USE
SOME
OF
THE
MONEY
FOR
SOMETHING
ELSE
AND
AS
FOR
THE
COFFEE
RATHER
THAN
ASKING
WHICH
BLEND
OF
COFFEE
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TODAY
ASK
YOURSELF
WHETHER
YOU
SHOULD
EVEN
BE
HAVING
THAT
HABITUAL
CUP
OF
EXPENSIVE
COFFEE
AT
WE
SHOULD
ALSO
PAY
PARTICULAR
ATTENTION
TO
THE
FIRST
DECI
SION
WE
MAKE
IN
WHAT
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
LONG
STREAM
OF
DECI
SIONS
ABOUT
CLOTHING
FOOD
ETC
WHEN
WE
FACE
SUCH
A
DECISION
IT
MIGHT
SEEM
TO
US
THAT
THIS
IS
JUST
ONE
DECISION
WITHOUT
LARGE
CONSEQUENCES
BUT
IN
FACT
THE
POWER
OF
THE
FIRST
DECISION
CAN
HAVE
SUCH
A
LONG
LASTING
EFFECT
THAT
IT
WILL
PERCO
LATE
INTO
OUR
FUTURE
DECISIONS
FOR
YEARS
TO
COME
GIVEN
THIS
EFFECT
THE
FIRST
DECISION
IS
CRUCIAL
AND
WE
SHOULD
GIVE
IT
AN
APPROPRIATE
AMOUNT
OF
ATTENTION
SOCRATES
SAID
THAT
THE
UNEXAMINED
LIFE
IS
NOT
WORTH
LIVING
PERHAPS
IT
TIME
TO
INVENTORY
THE
IMPRINTS
AND
ANCHORS
IN
OUR
OWN
LIFE
EVEN
IF
THEY
ONCE
WERE
COMPLETELY
REASONABLE
ARE
THEY
STILL
REASONABLE
ONCE
THE
OLD
CHOICES
ARE
RECONSIDERED
I
AM
NOT
CLAIMING
THAT
SPENDING
MONEY
ON
A
WONDERFUL
CUP
OF
COFFEE
EVERY
DAY
OR
EVEN
A
FEW
TIMES
A
DAY
IS
NECESSARILY
A
BAD
DECISION
I
AM
SAYING
ONLY
THAT
WE
SHOULD
QUESTION
OUR
DECISIONS
WE
CAN
OPEN
OURSELVES
TO
NEW
DECISIONS
AND
THE
NEW
OP
PORTUNITIES
OF
A
NEW
DAY
THAT
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
SENSE
ALL
THIS
TALK
ABOUT
ANCHORS
AND
GOSLINGS
HAS
LARGER
IMPLI
CATIONS
THAN
CONSUMER
PREFERENCES
HOWEVER
TRADITIONAL
ECONOMICS
ASSUMES
THAT
PRICES
OF
PRODUCTS
IN
THE
MARKET
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
A
BALANCE
BETWEEN
TWO
FORCES
PRODUCTION
AT
EACH
PRICE
SUPPLY
AND
THE
DESIRES
OF
THOSE
WITH
PURCHASING
POWER
AT
EACH
PRICE
DEMAND
THE
PRICE
AT
WHICH
THESE
TWO
FORCES
MEET
DETERMINES
THE
PRICES
IN
THE
MARKETPLACE
THIS
IS
AN
ELEGANT
IDEA
BUT
IT
DEPENDS
CENTRALLY
ON
THE
AS
SUMPTION
THAT
THE
TWO
FORCES
ARE
INDEPENDENT
AND
THAT
TO
GETHER
THEY
PRODUCE
THE
MARKET
PRICE
THE
RESULTS
OF
ALL
THE
EXPERIMENTS
PRESENTED
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
AND
THE
BASIC
IDEA
OF
ARBITRARY
COHERENCE
ITSELF
CHALLENGE
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
FIRST
ACCORDING
TO
THE
STANDARD
ECONOMIC
FRAMEWORK
CONSUMERS
WILLINGNESS
TO
PAY
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
INPUTS
THAT
DETERMINE
MARKET
PRICES
THIS
IS
THE
DEMAND
BUT
AS
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
DEMONSTRATE
WHAT
CONSUMERS
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
CAN
EASILY
BE
MANIPULATED
AND
THIS
MEANS
THAT
CONSUMERS
DON
T
IN
FACT
HAVE
A
GOOD
HANDLE
ON
THEIR
OWN
PREFERENCES
AND
THE
PRICES
THEY
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
FOR
DIFFERENT
GOODS
AND
EXPERIENCES
SECOND
WHEREAS
THE
STANDARD
ECONOMIC
FRAMEWORK
AS
SUMES
THAT
THE
FORCES
OF
SUPPLY
AND
DEMAND
ARE
INDEPENDENT
THE
TYPE
OF
ANCHORING
MANIPULATIONS
WE
HAVE
SHOWN
HERE
SUGGEST
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
FACT
DEPENDENT
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
ANCHORING
COMES
FROM
MANUFACTURER
SUGGESTED
RETAIL
PRICES
MSRPS
ADVERTISED
PRICES
PROMOTIONS
PRODUCT
INTRODUC
TIONS
ETC
ALL
OF
WHICH
ARE
SUPPLY
SIDE
VARIABLES
IT
SEEMS
THEN
THAT
INSTEAD
OF
CONSUMERS
WILLINGNESS
TO
PAY
INFLUENC
ING
MARKET
PRICES
THE
CAUSALITY
IS
SOMEWHAT
REVERSED
AND
IT
IS
MARKET
PRICES
THEMSELVES
THAT
INFLUENCE
CONSUMERS
WILLING
NESS
TO
PAY
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
IS
THAT
DEMAND
IS
NOT
IN
FACT
A
COMPLETELY
SEPARATE
FORCE
FROM
SUPPLY
AND
THIS
NOT
THE
END
OF
THE
STORY
IN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
AR
BITRARY
COHERENCE
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
WE
SEE
IN
THE
MARKETPLACE
BETWEEN
DEMAND
AND
SUPPLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUYING
MORE
YO
GURT
WHEN
IT
IS
DISCOUNTED
ARE
BASED
NOT
ON
PREFERENCES
BUT
ON
MEMORY
HERE
IS
AN
ILLUSTRATION
OF
THIS
IDEA
CONSIDER
YOUR
CUR
RENT
CONSUMPTION
OF
MILK
AND
WINE
NOW
IMAGINE
THAT
TWO
NEW
TAXES
WILL
BE
INTRODUCED
TOMORROW
ONE
WILL
CUT
THE
PRICE
OF
WINE
BY
PERCENT
AND
THE
OTHER
WILL
INCREASE
THE
PRICE
OF
MILK
BY
PERCENT
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
WILL
HAPPEN
THESE
PRICE
CHANGES
WILL
SURELY
AFFECT
CONSUMPTION
AND
MANY
PEOPLE
WILL
WALK
AROUND
SLIGHTLY
HAPPIER
AND
WITH
LESS
CALCIUM
BUT
NOW
IMAGINE
THIS
WHAT
IF
THE
NEW
TAXES
ARE
ACCOMPANIED
BY
INDUCED
AMNESIA
FOR
THE
PREVIOUS
PRICES
OF
WINE
AND
MILK
WHAT
IF
THE
PRICES
CHANGE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
BUT
YOU
DO
NOT
RE
MEMBER
WHAT
YOU
PAID
FOR
THESE
TWO
PRODUCTS
IN
THE
PAST
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
PRICE
CHANGES
WOULD
MAKE
A
HUGE
IM
PACT
ON
DEMAND
IF
PEOPLE
REMEMBERED
THE
PREVIOUS
PRICES
AND
NOTICED
THE
PRICE
INCREASES
BUT
I
ALSO
SUSPECT
THAT
WITH
OUT
A
MEMORY
FOR
PAST
PRICES
THESE
PRICE
CHANGES
WOULD
HAVE
A
TRIVIAL
EFFECT
IF
ANY
ON
DEMAND
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
NO
MEMORY
OF
PAST
PRICES
THE
CONSUMPTION
OF
MILK
AND
WINE
WOULD
RE
MAIN
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
AS
IF
THE
PRICES
HAD
NOT
CHANGED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THE
SENSITIVITY
WE
SHOW
TO
PRICE
CHANGES
MIGHT
IN
FACT
BE
LARGELY
A
RESULT
OF
OUR
MEMORY
FOR
THE
PRICES
WE
HAVE
PAID
IN
THE
PAST
AND
OUR
DESIRE
FOR
COHERENCE
WITH
OUR
PAST
DECISIONS
NOT
AT
ALL
A
REFLECTION
OF
OUR
TRUE
PREFER
ENCES
OR
OUR
LEVEL
OF
DEMAND
THESAME
BASIC
PRINCIPLE
WOULD
ALSO
APPLY
IF
THE
GOVERN
MENT
ONE
DAY
DECIDED
TO
IMPOSE
A
TAX
THAT
DOUBLED
THE
PRICE
OF
GASOLINE
UNDER
CONVENTIONAL
ECONOMIC
THEORY
THIS
SHOULD
CUT
DEMAND
BUT
WOULD
IT
CERTAINLY
PEOPLE
WOULD
INITIALLY
COM
PARE
THE
NEW
PRICES
WITH
THEIR
ANCHOR
WOULD
BE
FLABBERGASTED
BY
THE
NEW
PRICES
AND
SO
MIGHT
PULL
BACK
ON
THEIR
GASOLINE
CONSUMPTION
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
GET
A
HYBRID
CAR
BUT
OVER
THE
LONG
RUN
AND
ONCE
CONSUMERS
READJUSTED
TO
THE
NEW
PRICE
AND
THE
NEW
ANCHORS
JUST
AS
WE
ADJUST
TO
THE
PRICE
OF
NIKE
SNEAK
ERS
BOTTLED
WATER
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
OUR
GASOLINE
CONSUMP
TION
AT
THE
NEW
PRICE
MIGHT
IN
FACT
GET
CLOSE
TO
THE
PRETAX
LEVEL
MOREOVER
MUCH
AS
IN
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
STARBUCKS
THIS
PROCESS
OF
READJUSTMENT
COULD
BE
ACCELERATED
IF
THE
PRICE
CHANGE
WERE
TO
ALSO
BE
ACCOMPANIED
BY
OTHER
CHANGES
SUCH
AS
A
NEW
GRADE
OF
GAS
OR
A
NEW
TYPE
OF
FUEL
SUCH
AS
CORN
BASED
ETHANOL
FUEL
I
AM
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
DOUBLING
THE
PRICE
OF
GASOLINE
WOULD
HAVE
NO
EFFECT
ON
CONSUMERS
DEMAND
BUT
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
IN
THE
LONG
TERM
IT
WOULD
HAVE
A
MUCH
SMALLER
INFLUENCE
ON
DEMAND
THAN
WOULD
BE
ASSUMED
FROM
JUST
OBSERVING
THE
SHORT
TERM
MARKET
REACTIONS
TO
PRICE
INCREASES
ANOTHER
IMPLICATION
OF
ARBITRARY
COHERENCE
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
CLAIMED
BENEFITS
OF
THE
FREE
MARKET
AND
FREE
TRADE
THE
BASIC
IDEA
OF
THE
FREE
MARKET
IS
THAT
IF
I
HAVE
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
VALUE
MORE
THAN
I
DO
LET
SAY
A
SOFA
TRADING
THIS
ITEM
WILL
BENEFIT
BOTH
OF
US
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
MUTUAL
BEN
EFIT
OF
TRADING
RESTS
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
ALL
THE
PLAYERS
IN
THE
MARKET
KNOW
THE
VALUE
OF
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
AND
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
THINGS
THEY
ARE
CONSIDERING
GETTING
FROM
THE
TRADE
BUT
IF
OUR
CHOICES
ARE
OFTEN
AFFECTED
BY
RANDOM
INITIAL
ANCHORS
AS
WE
OBSERVED
IN
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
THE
CHOICES
AND
TRADES
WE
MAKE
ARE
NOT
NECESSARILY
GOING
TO
BE
AN
ACCURATE
RE
FLECTION
OF
THE
REAL
PLEASURE
OR
UTILITY
WE
DERIVE
FROM
THOSE
PROD
UCTS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IN
MANY
CASES
WE
MAKE
DECISIONS
IN
THE
MARKETPLACE
THAT
MAY
NOT
REFLECT
HOW
MUCH
PLEASURE
WE
CAN
GET
FROM
DIFFERENT
ITEMS
NOW
IF
WE
CAN
T
ACCURATELY
COMPUTE
THESE
PLEASURE
VALUES
BUT
FREQUENTLY
FOLLOW
ARBITRARY
ANCHORS
INSTEAD
THEN
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
TRADE
IS
NECESSARILY
GOING
TO
MAKE
US
BETTER
OFF
FOR
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
OF
SOME
UN
FORTUNATE
INITIAL
ANCHORS
WE
MIGHT
MISTAKENLY
TRADE
SOMETHING
THAT
TRULY
GIVES
US
A
LOT
OF
PLEASURE
BUT
REGRETTABLY
HAD
A
LOW
INITIAL
ANCHOR
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
GIVES
US
LESS
PLEASURE
BUT
OW
ING
TO
SOME
RANDOM
CIRCUMSTANCES
HAD
A
HIGH
INITIAL
ANCHOR
IF
ANCHORS
AND
MEMORIES
OF
THESE
ANCHORS
BUT
NOT
PREFERENCES
DETERMINE
OUR
BEHAVIOR
WHY
WOULD
TRADING
BE
HAILED
AS
THE
KEY
TO
MAXIMIZING
PERSONAL
HAPPINESS
UTILITY
SO
WHERE
DOES
THIS
LEAVE
US
IF
WE
CAN
T
RELY
ON
THE
MARKET
FORCES
OF
SUPPLY
AND
DEMAND
TO
SET
OPTIMAL
MARKET
PRICES
AND
WE
CAN
T
COUNT
ON
FREE
MARKET
MECHANISMS
TO
HELP
US
MAXI
MIZE
OUR
UTILITY
THEN
WE
MAY
NEED
TO
LOOK
ELSEWHERE
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
THE
CASE
WITH
SOCIETY
ESSENTIALS
SUCH
AS
HEALTH
CARE
MEDICINE
WATER
ELECTRICITY
EDUCATION
AND
OTHER
CRITICAL
RE
SOURCES
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
THE
PREMISE
THAT
MARKET
FORCES
AND
FREE
MARKETS
WILL
NOT
ALWAYS
REGULATE
THE
MARKET
FOR
THE
BEST
THEN
YOU
MAY
FIND
YOURSELF
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
GOV
ERNMENT
WE
HOPE
A
REASONABLE
AND
THOUGHTFUL
GOVERNMENT
MUST
PLAY
A
LARGER
ROLE
IN
REGULATING
SOME
MARKET
ACTIVITIES
EVEN
IF
THIS
LIMITS
FREE
ENTERPRISE
YES
A
FREE
MARK
T
BASED
ON
SUPPLY
DEMAND
AND
NO
FRICTION
WOULD
BE
THE
IDEAL
IF
WE
WERE
TRULY
RATIONAL
YET
WHEN
WE
ARE
NOT
RATIONAL
BUT
IRRATIONAL
POLICIES
SHOULD
TAKE
THIS
IMPORTANT
FACTOR
INTO
ACCOUNT
CHAPTER
THE
COST
OF
ZERO
COST
WHY
WE
OFTEN
PAY
TOO
MUCH
WHEN
WE
PAY
NOTHING

YOU

THE

YOUR

IT
NO

THAT
GETTING
SOMETHING
FREE
FEELS
VERY
GOOD
ZERO
IS
NOT
JUST
ANOTHER

IT

OUT
ZERO
IS
AN
EMO

HOT

A

YOU

WHAT
IS
IT
ABOUT

THAT
WE
FIND
SO
IRRESISTIBLE
WHY
DOES

MAKE
US
SO
HAPPY
AFTER
ALL
FREE

THE

WHERE
ZERO
ULTIMATELY
FOUND
PLENTY
OF

WITH

CALLED

SO
MUCH
FOR
A

RECOUNTING
OF

THE

APPLIED
TO

IS

I
DON

IT
EVEN
HAS

NONETHELESS
FREE
HAS
HUGE
IMPLICATIONS
EXTENDING
NOT

TO
DISCOUNT

AND

BUT
ALSO
TO
HOW

CAN
BE
USED
TO

US
MAKE
DECISIONS
THAT
WOULD
BENEFIT
OURSELVES
AND
SOCIETY
IF
FREE
WERE
A

I
MIGHT

WE
USE

THIS

KRISTINA
SHAMPANIER
A
PHD
STUDENT
AT
MIT
NINA
MAZAR
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
TORONTO
AND
I
WENT
INTO
THE
CHOCOLATE
BUSINESS
WELL
SORT
OF
WE
SET
UP
A
TABLE
AT
A
LARGE
PUBLIC
BUILDING
AND
OFFERED
TWO
KINDS
OF
CHOCOLATES
LINDT
TRUFFLES
AND
HERSHEY
KISSES
THERE
WAS
A
LARGE
SIGN
ABOVE
OUR
TABLE
THAT
READ
ONE
CHOCOLATE
PER
CUS
TOMER
ONCE
THE
POTENTIAL
CUSTOMERS
STEPPED
CLOSER
THEY
COULD
SEE
THE
TWO
TYPES
OF
CHOCOLATE
AND
THEIR
PRICES
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
ARE
NOT
CHOCOLATE
CONNOISSEURS
LINDT
IS
PRODUCED
BY
A
SWISS
FIRM
THAT
HAS
BEEN
BLENDING
FINE
COCOAS
FOR
YEARS
LINDT
CHOCOLATE
TRUFFLES
ARE
PARTICULARLY
PRIZED
EXQUISITELY
CREAMY
AND
JUST
ABOUT
IRRESISTIBLE
THEY
COST
ABOUT
CENTS
EACH
WHEN
WE
BUY
THEM
IN
BULK
HERSHEY
KISSES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ARE
GOOD
LITTLE
CHOCOLATES
BUT
LET
FACE
IT
THEY
ARE
RATHER
ORDINARY
HERSHEY
CRANKS
OUT
MILLION
KISSES
A
DAY
IN
HERSHEY
PENNSYLVANIA
EVEN
THE
STREETLAMPS
ARE
MADE
IN
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
UBIQUITOUS
HERSHEY
KISS
WE
POSTED
THE
PRICES
SO
THAT
THEY
WERE
VISIBLE
ONLY
WHEN
PEOPLE
GOT
CLOSE
TO
THE
TABLE
WE
DID
THIS
BECAUSE
WE
WANTED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
WE
DID
NOT
ATTRACT
DIFFERENT
TYPES
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
DIFFERENT
CONDITIONS
AVOIDING
WHAT
IS
CALLED
SELF
SELECTION
SO
WHAT
HAPPENED
WHEN
THE
CUSTOMERS
FLOCKED
TO
OUR
TABLE
WHEN
WE
SET
THE
PRICE
OF
A
LINDT
TRUFFLE
AT
CENTS
AND
A
KISS
AT
ONE
CENT
WE
WERE
NOT
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
THAT
OUR
CUS
TOMERS
ACTED
WITH
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
RATIONALITY
THEY
COMPARED
THE
PRICE
AND
QUALITY
OF
THE
KISS
WITH
THE
PRICE
AND
QUALITY
OF
THE
TRUFFLE
AND
THEN
MADE
THEIR
CHOICE
ABOUT
PERCENT
OF
THEM
CHOSE
THE
TRUFFLE
AND
PERCENT
CHOSE
A
KISS
NOW
WE
DECIDED
TO
SEE
HOW
FREE
MIGHT
CHANGE
THE
SITUATION
SO
WE
OFFERED
THE
LINDT
TRUFFLE
FOR
CENTS
AND
THE
KISSES
FREE
WOULD
THERE
BE
A
DIFFERENCE
SHOULD
THERE
BE
AFTER
ALL
WE
HAD
MERELY
LOWERED
THE
PRICE
OF
BOTH
KINDS
OF
CHOCOLATE
BY
ONE
CENT
BUT
WHAT
A
DIFFERENCE
FREE
MADE
THE
HUMBLE
HERSHEY
KISS
BECAME
A
BIG
FAVORITE
SOME
PERCENT
OF
OUR
CUSTOMERS
UP
FROM
PERCENT
BEFORE
CHOSE
THE
FREE
KISS
GIVING
UP
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GET
THE
LINDT
TRUFFLE
FOR
A
VERY
GOOD
PRICE
MEANWHILE
THE
LINDT
TRUFFLE
TOOK
A
TUMBLE
CUSTOMERS
CHOOS
ING
IT
DECREASED
FROM
TO
PERCENT
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
HERE
FIRST
OF
ALL
LET
ME
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
TIMES
WHEN
GETTING
FREE
ITEMS
CAN
MAKE
PERFECT
SENSE
IF
YOU
FIND
A
BIN
OF

AT

THERE
NO

ALL
THE

YOU
CAN
THE
CRITICAL
ISSUE
ARISES
WHEN
FREE
BECOMES
A
STRUGGLE
BE
TWEEN
A
FREE
ITEM
AND
ANOTHER
ITEM
A
STRUGGLE
IN
WHICH
THE
PRESENCE
OF
FREE
LEADS
US
TO
MAKE
A
BAD
DECISION
FOR
INSTANCE
IMAGINE
GOING
TO
A
SPORTS
STORE
TO
BUY
A
PAIR
OF
WHITE
SOCKS
THE
KIND
WITH
A
NICELY
PADDED
HEEL
AND
A
GOLD
TOE
FIFTEEN
MINUTES
LATER
YOU
RE
LEAVING
THE
STORE
NOT
WITH
THE
SOCKS
YOU
CAME
IN
FOR
BUT
WITH
A
CHEAPER
PAIR
THAT
YOU
DON
T
LIKE
AT
ALL
WITHOUT
A
PAD
DED
HEEL
AND
GOLD
TOE
BUT
THAT
CAME
IN
A
PACKAGE
WITH
A
FREE
SECOND
PAIR
THIS
IS
A
CASE
IN
WHICH
YOU
GAVE
UP
A
BETTER
DEAL
AND
SETTLED
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
NOT
WHAT
YOU
WANTED
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
WERE
LURED
BY
THE
FREE
TO
REPLICATE
THIS
EXPERIENCE
IN
OUR
CHOCOLATE
EXPERIMENT
WE
TOLD
OUR
CUSTOMERS
THAT
THEY
COULD
CHOOSE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
SWEET
THE
KISS
OR
THE
TRUFFLE
IT
WAS
AN
EITHER
OR
DECISION
LIKE
CHOOSING
ONE
KIND
OF
ATHLETIC
SOCK
OVER
ANOTHER
THAT
WHAT
MADE
THE
CUSTOMERS
REACTION
TO
THE
FREE
KISS
SO
DRAMATIC
BOTH
CHOCOLATES
WERE
DISCOUNTED
BY
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
MONEY
THE
RELATIVE
PRICE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
WAS
UNCHANGED
AND
SO
WAS
THE
EXPECTED
PLEASURE
FROM
BOTH
ACCORDING
TO
STANDARD
ECONOMIC
THEORY
SIMPLE
COST
BENEFIT
ANALYSIS
THEN
THE
PRICE
REDUCTION
SHOULD
NOT
LEAD
TO
ANY
CHANGE
IN
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
OUR
CUSTOMERS
BEFORE
ABOUT
PERCENT
CHOSE
THE
KISS
AND
PERCENT
CHOSE
THE
TRUFFLE
AND
SINCE
NOTHING
HAD
CHANGED
IN
RELATIVE
TERMS
THE
RESPONSE
TO
THE
PRICE
REDUCTION
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
A
PASSING
ECONOMIST
TWIRLING
HIS
CANE
AND
ESPOUSING
CONVEN
TIONAL
ECONOMIC
THEORY
IN
FACT
WOULD
HAVE
SAID
THAT
SINCE
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
SITUATION
WAS
THE
SAME
OUR
CUSTOMERS
SHOULD
HAVE
CHOSEN
THE
TRUFFLES
BY
THE
SAME
MARGIN
OF
PREFERENCE
AND
YET
HERE
WE
WERE
WITH
PEOPLE
PRESSING
UP
TO
THE
TABLE
TO
GRAB
OUR
HERSHEY
KISSES
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
MADE
A
REASONED
COST
BENEFIT
ANALYSIS
BEFORE
ELBOWING
THEIR
WAY
IN
BUT
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
KISSES
WERE
FREE
HOW
STRANGE
BUT
PREDICTABLE
WE
HUMANS
ARE
THIS
CONCLUSION
INCIDENTALLY
REMAINED
THE
SAME
IN
OTHER
EXPERIMENTS
AS
WELL
IN
ONE
CASE
WE
PRICED
THE
HERSHEY
KISS
AT
TWO
CENTS
ONE
CENT
AND
ZERO
CENTS
WHILE
PRICING
THE
TRUFFLE
CORRESPONDINGLY
AT
CENTS
CENTS
AND
CENTS
FOR
A
MORE
DETAILED
ACCOUNT
OF
HOW
A
RATIONAL
CONSUMER
SHOULD
MAKE
DECISIONS
IN
THESE
CASES
SEE
THE
APPENDIX
TO
THIS
CHAPTER
WE
DID
THIS
TO
SEE
IF
DISCOUNTING
THE
KISS
FROM
TWO
CENTS
TO
ONE
CENT
AND
THE
TRUFFLE
FROM
CENTS
TO
CENTS
WOULD
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
PROPORTION
OF
BUYERS
FOR
EACH
IT
DIDN
T
BUT
ONCE
AGAIN
WHEN
WE
LOWERED
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
KISS
TO
FREE
THE
REACTION
WAS
DRAMATIC
THE
SHOPPERS
OVERWHELM
INGLY
DEMANDED
THE
KISSES
WE
DECIDED
THAT
PERHAPS
THE
EXPERIMENT
HAD
BEEN
TAINTED
SINCE
SHOPPERS
MAY
NOT
FEEL
LIKE
SEARCHING
FOR
CHANGE
IN
A
PURSE
OR
BACKPACK
OR
THEY
MAY
NOT
HAVE
ANY
MONEY
ON
THEM
SUCH
AN
EFFECT
WOULD
ARTIFICIALLY
MAKE
THE
FREE
OFFER
SEEM
MORE
ATTRACTIVE
TO
ADDRESS
THIS
POSSIBILITY
WE
RAN
OTHER
EX
PERIMENTS
AT
ONE
OF
MIT
CAFETERIAS
IN
THIS
SETUP
THE
CHOCO
LATES
WERE
DISPLAYED
NEXT
TO
THE
CASHIER
AS
ONE
OF
THE
CAFETERIA
REGULAR
PROMOTIONS
AND
THE
STUDENTS
WHO
WERE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CHOCOLATES
SIMPLY
ADDED
THEM
TO
THE
LUNCH
PURCHASE
AND
PAID
FOR
THEM
WHILE
GOING
THROUGH
THE
CASHIER
LINE
WHAT
HAPPENED
THE
STUDENTS
STILL
WENT
OVERWHELMINGLY
FOR
THE
FREE
OPTION
WHAT
IS
IT
ABOUT
FREE
THAT
SO
ENTICING
WHY
DO
WE
HAVE
AN
IRRATIONAL
URGE
TO
JUMP
FOR
A
FREE
ITEM
EVEN
WHEN
IT
NOT
WHAT
WE
REALLY
WANT
I
BELIEVE
THE
ANSWER
IS
THIS
MOST
TRANSACTIONS
HAVE
AN
UP
SIDE
AND
A
DOWNSIDE
BUT
WHEN
SOMETHING
IS
FREE
WE
FORGET
THE
DOWNSIDE
FREE
GIVES
US
SUCH
AN
EMOTIONAL
CHARGE
THAT
WE
PERCEIVE
WHAT
IS
BEING
OFFERED
AS
IMMENSELY
MORE
VALU
ABLE
THAN
IT
REALLY
IS
WHY
I
THINK
IT
BECAUSE
HUMANS
ARE
INTRINSICALLY
AFRAID
OF
LOSS
THE
REAL
ALLURE
OF
FREE
IS
TIED
TO
THIS
FEAR
THERE
NO
VISIBLE
POSSIBILITY
OF
LOSS
WHEN
WE
CHOOSE
A
FREE
ITEM
IT
FREE
BUT
SUPPOSE
WE
CHOOSE
THE
ITEM
THAT
NOT
FREE
UH
OH
NOW
THERE
A
RISK
OF
HAVING
MADE
A
POOR
DECISION
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
LOSS
AND
SO
GIVEN
THE
CHOICE
WE
GO
FOR
WHAT
IS
FREE
FOR
THIS
REASON
IN
THE
LAND
OF
PRICING
ZERO
IS
NOT
JUST
AN
OTHER
PRICE
SURE
CENTS
CAN
MAKE
A
HUGE
DIFFERENCE
IN
DE
MAND
SUPPOSE
YOU
WERE
SELLING
MILLIONS
OF
BARRELS
OF
OIL
BUT
NOTHING
BEATS
THE
EMOTIONAL
SURGE
OF
FREE
THIS
THE
ZERO
PRICE
EFFECT
IS
IN
A
CATEGORY
ALL
ITS
OWN
TO
BE
SURE
BUYING
SOMETHING
FOR
NOTHING
IS
A
BIT
OF
AN
OXYMORON
BUT
LET
ME
GIVE
YOU
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
WE
OFTEN
FALL
INTO
THE
TRAP
OF
BUYING
SOMETHING
WE
MAY
NOT
WANT
SIM
PLY
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
STICKY
SUBSTANCE
FREE
I
RECENTLY
SAW
A
NEWSPAPER
AD
FROM
A
MAJOR
ELECTRONICS
MAKER
OFFERING
ME
SEVEN
FREE
DVD
TITLES
IF
I
PURCHASED
THE
MAKER
NEW
HIGH
DEFINITION
DVD
PLAYER
FIRST
OF
ALL
DO
I
NEED
A
HIGH
DEFINITION
PLAYER
RIGHT
NOW
PROBABLY
NOT
BUT
EVEN
IF
I
DID
WOULDN
T
IT
BE
WISER
TO
WAIT
FOR
PRICES
TO
DE
SCEND
THEY
ALWAYS
DO
AND
TODAY
HIGH
DEFINITION
DVD
PLAYER
WILL
VERY
QUICKLY
BE
TOMORROW
MACHINE
SECOND
THE
DVD
MAKER
HAD
A
CLEAR
AGENDA
BEHIND
ITS
OFFER
THIS
COMPANY
HIGH
DEFINITION
DVD
SYSTEM
IS
IN
CUTTHROAT
COMPETITION
WITH
BLU
RAY
A
SYSTEM
BACKED
BY
MANY
OTHER
MANUFACTURERS
RIGHT
NOW
BLU
RAY
IS
AHEAD
AND
COULD
POS
SIBLY
DOMINATE
THE
MARKET
SO
HOW
MUCH
IS
FREE
WHEN
THE
MACHINE
BEING
OFFERED
MAY
FIND
ITS
WAY
INTO
OBSOLESCENCE
LIKE
BETAMAX
VCRS
THOSE
ARE
TWO
RATIONAL
THOUGHTS
THAT
MIGHT
PREVENT
US
FROM
FALLING
UNDER
THE
SPELL
OF
FREE
BUT
GEE
THOSE
FREE
DVDS
CERTAINLY
LOOK
GOOD
GETTING
SOMETHING
FREE
IS
CERTAINLY
A
DRAW
WHEN
WE
TALK
ABOUT
PRICES
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
THE
OFFER
WAS
NOT
A
FREE
PRICE
BUT
A
FREE
EXCHANGE
ARE
WE
AS
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
FREE
PRODUCTS
AS
WE
ARE
TO
GETTING
PRODUCTS
FOR
FREE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WITH
HALLOWEEN
DRAWING
NEAR
I
HAD
AN
IDEA
FOR
AN
EX
PERIMENT
TO
PROBE
THAT
QUESTION
THIS
TIME
I
WOULDN
T
EVEN
HAVE
TO
LEAVE
MY
HOME
TO
GET
MY
ANSWERS
EARLY
IN
THE
EVENING
JOEY
A
NINE
YEAR
OLD
KID
DRESSED
AS
SPIDER
MAN
AND
CARRYING
A
LARGE
YELLOW
BAG
CLIMBED
THE
STAIRS
OF
OUR
FRONT
PORCH
HIS
MOTHER
ACCOMPANIED
HIM
TO
ENSURE
THAT
NO
ONE
GAVE
HER
KID
AN
APPLE
WITH
A
RAZOR
BLADE
INSIDE
BY
THE
WAY
THERE
NEVER
WAS
A
CASE
OF
RAZOR
BLADES
BE
ING
DISTRIBUTED
IN
APPLES
ON
HALLOWEEN
IT
IS
JUST
AN
URBAN
MYTH
SHE
STAYED
ON
THE
SIDEWALK
HOWEVER
TO
GIVE
JOEY
THE
FEELING
THAT
HE
WAS
TRICK
OR
TREATING
BY
HIMSELF
AFTER
THE
TRADITIONAL
QUERY
TRICK
OR
TREAT
I
ASKED
JOEY
TO
HOLD
OPEN
HIS
RIGHT
HAND
I
PLACED
THREE
HERSHEY
KISSES
IN
HIS
PALM
AND
ASKED
HIM
TO
HOLD
THEM
THERE
FOR
A
MOMENT
YOU
CAN
ALSO
GET
ONE
OF
THESE
TWO
SNICKERS
BARS
I
SAID
SHOWING
HIM
A
SMALL
ONE
AND
A
LARGE
ONE
IN
FACT
IF
YOU
GIVE
ME
ONE
OF
THOSE
HERSHEY
KISSES
I
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THIS
SMALLER
SNICKERS
BAR
AND
IF
YOU
GIVE
ME
TWO
OF
YOUR
HERSHEY
KISSES
I
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THIS
LARGER
SNICKERS
BAR
NOW
A
KID
MAY
DRESS
UP
LIKE
A
GIANT
SPIDER
BUT
THAT
DOESN
T
MEAN
HE
STUPID
THE
SMALL
SNICKERS
BAR
WEIGHED
ONE
OUNCE
AND
THE
LARGE
SNICKERS
BAR
WEIGHED
TWO
OUNCES
ALL
JOEY
HAD
TO
DO
WAS
GIVE
ME
ONE
ADDITIONAL
HERSHEY
KISS
ABOUT
OUNCE
AND
HE
WOULD
GET
AN
EXTRA
OUNCE
OF
SNICK
ERS
THIS
DEAL
MIGHT
HAVE
STUMPED
A
ROCKET
SCIENTIST
BUT
FOR
A
NINE
YEAR
OLD
BOY
THE
COMPUTATION
WAS
EASY
HE
D
GET
MORE
THAN
SIX
TIMES
THE
RETURN
ON
INVESTMENT
IN
THE
NET
WEIGHT
OF
CHOCOLATE
IF
HE
WENT
FOR
THE
LARGER
SNICKERS
BAR
IN
A
FLASH
JOEY
PUT
TWO
OF
HIS
KISSES
INTO
MY
HAND
TOOK
THE
TWO
OUNCE
SNICKERS
BAR
AND
DROPPED
IT
INTO
HIS
BAG
JOEY
WASN
T
ALONE
IN
MAKING
THIS
SNAP
DECISION
ALL
BUT
ONE
OF
THE
KIDS
TO
WHOM
I
PRESENTED
THIS
OFFER
TRADED
IN
TWO
KISSES
FOR
THE
BIGGER
CANDY
BARS
ZOE
WAS
THE
NEXT
KID
TO
WALK
DOWN
THE
STREET
SHE
WAS
DRESSED
AS
A
PRINCESS
IN
A
LONG
WHITE
DRESS
WITH
A
MAGIC
WAND
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
AN
ORANGE
HALLOWEEN
PUMPKIN
BUCKET
IN
THE
OTHER
HER
YOUNGER
SISTER
WAS
RESTING
COMFORTABLY
IN
THEIR
FATHER
ARMS
LOOKING
CUTE
AND
CUDDLY
IN
HER
BUNNY
OUTFIT
AS
THEY
APPROACHED
ZOE
CALLED
OUT
IN
A
HIGH
CUTE
VOICE
TRICK
OR
TREAT
IN
THE
PAST
I
ADMIT
THAT
I
HAVE
SOME
TIMES
DEVILISHLY
REPLIED
TRICK
MOST
KIDS
STAND
THERE
BAF
FLED
HAVING
NEVER
THOUGHT
THROUGH
THEIR
QUESTION
TO
SEE
THAT
IT
ALLOWED
AN
ALTERNATIVE
ANSWER
IN
THIS
CASE
I
GAVE
ZOE
HER
TREAT
THREE
HERSHEY
KISSES
BUT
I
DID
HAVE
A
TRICK
UP
MY
SLEEVE
I
OFFERED
LITTLE
ZOE
A
DEAL
A
CHOICE
BETWEEN
GETTING
A
LARGE
SNICKERS
BAR
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
ONE
OF
HER
HERSHEY
KISSES
OR
GETTING
THE
SMALL
SNICKERS
BAR
FOR
FREE
WITHOUT
GIVING
UP
ANY
HERSHEY
KISSES
NOW
A
BIT
OF
RATIONAL
CALCULATION
WHICH
IN
JOEY
CASE
WAS
AMPLY
DEMONSTRATED
WOULD
SHOW
THAT
THE
BEST
DEAL
IS
TO
FORGO
THE
FREE
SMALL
SNICKERS
BAR
PAY
THE
COST
OF
ONE
AD
DITIONAL
HERSHEY
KISS
AND
GO
FOR
THE
LARGE
SNICKERS
BAR
ON
AN
OUNCE
FOR
OUNCE
COMPARISON
IT
WAS
FAR
BETTER
TO
GIVE
UP
ONE
ADDITIONAL
HERSHEY
KISS
AND
GET
THE
LARGER
SNICKERS
BAR
TWO
OUNCES
INSTEAD
OF
A
SMALLER
SNICKERS
BAR
ONE
OUNCE
THIS
LOGIC
WAS
PERFECTLY
CLEAR
TO
JOE
AND
THE
KIDS
WHO
ENCOUNTERED
THE
CONDITION
IN
WHICH
BOTH
SNICKERS
BARS
HAD
A
COST
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
ZOE
DO
WOULD
HER
CLEVER
KID
MIND
MAKE
THAT
RATIONAL
CHOICE
OR
WOULD
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SMALL
SNICKERS
BAR
WAS
FREE
BLIND
HER
TO
THE
RATIO
NALLY
CORRECT
ANSWER
AS
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
GUESSED
BY
NOW
ZOE
AND
THE
OTHER
KIDS
TO
WHOM
I
OFFERED
THE
SAME
DEAL
WAS
COMPLETELY
BLINDED
BY
FREE
ABOUT
PERCENT
OF
THEM
GAVE
UP
THE
BETTER
DEAL
AND
TOOK
THE
WORSE
DEAL
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
FREE
JUST
IN
CASE
YOU
THINK
KRISTINA
NINA
AND
I
MAKE
A
HABIT
OF
PICKING
ON
KIDS
I
LL
MENTION
THAT
WE
REPEATED
THE
EXPERI
MENT
WITH
BIGGER
KIDS
IN
FACT
STUDENTS
AT
THE
MIT
STUDENT
CENTER
THE
RESULTS
REPLICATED
THE
PATTERN
WE
SAW
ON
HALLOW
EEN
INDEED
THE
DRAW
OF
ZERO
COST
IS
NOT
LIMITED
TO
MONETARY
TRANSACTIONS
WHETHER
IT
PRODUCTS
OR
MONEY
WE
JUST
CAN
T
RESIST
THE
GRAVITATIONAL
PULL
OF
FREE
SO
DO
YO
U
THINK
YOU
HAVE
A
HANDLE
ON
FREE
OK
HERE
A
QUIZ
SUPPOSE
I
OFFERED
YOU
A
CHOICE
BE
TWEEN
A
FREE
AMAZON
GIFT
CERTIFICATE
AND
A
GIFT
CER
TIFICATE
FOR
SEVEN
DOLLARS
THINK
QUICKLY
WHICH
WOULD
YOU
TAKE
IF
YOU
JUMPED
FOR
THE
FREE
CERTIFICATE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
LIKE
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WE
TESTED
AT
ONE
OF
THE
MALLS
IN
BOSTON
BUT
LOOK
AGAIN
A
GIFT
CERTIFICATE
FOR
SEVEN
DOLLARS
DELIVERS
A
PROFIT
THAT
CLEARLY
BETTER
THAN
GETTING
A
CERTIFICATE
FREE
EARNING
CAN
YOU
SEE
THE
IRRATIONAL
BE
HAVIOR
IN
ACTION
LET
ME
TELL
YOU
A
STORY
THAT
DESCRIBES
THE
REAL
INFLUENCE
OF
FREE
ON
OUR
BEHAVIOR
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
AMAZON
COM
STARTED
OFFERING
FREE
SHIPPING
OF
ORDERS
OVER
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
SOME
ONE
WHO
PURCHASED
A
SINGLE
BOOK
FOR
MIGHT
PAY
AN
ADDITIONAL
FOR
SHIPPING
FOR
INSTANCE
BUT
IF
THE
CUS
WE
ALSO
CONDUCTED
THE
EXPERIMENT
OFFERING
THE
GIFT
CERTIFICATE
FOR
ONE
DOLLAR
AND
THE
CERTIFICATE
FOR
EIGHT
DOLLARS
THIS
TIME
MOST
OF
THE
PARTICIPANTS
JUMPED
FOR
THE
CERTIFICATE
TOMER
BOUGHT
ANOTHER
BOOK
FOR
A
TOTAL
OF
THEY
WOULD
GET
THEIR
SHIPPING
FREE
SOME
OF
THE
PURCHASERS
PROBABLY
DIDN
T
WANT
THE
SECOND
BOOK
AND
I
AM
TALKING
HERE
FROM
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
BUT
THE
FREE
SHIPPING
WAS
SO
TEMPTING
THAT
TO
GET
IT
THEY
WERE
WILLING
TO
PAY
THE
COST
OF
THE
EXTRA
BOOK
THE
PEOPLE
AT
AMA
ZON
WERE
VERY
HAPPY
WITH
THIS
OFFER
BUT
THEY
NOTICED
THAT
IN
ONE
PLACE
FRANCE
THERE
WAS
NO
INCREASE
IN
SALES
IS
THE
FRENCH
CONSUMER
MORE
RATIONAL
THAN
THE
REST
OF
US
UNLIKELY
RATHER
IT
TURNED
OUT
THE
FRENCH
CUSTOMERS
WERE
REACTING
TO
A
DIFFERENT
DEAL
HERE
WHAT
HAPPENED
INSTEAD
OF
OFFERING
FREE
SHIPPING
ON
ORDERS
OVER
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
THE
FRENCH
DIVISION
PRICED
THE
SHIPPING
FOR
THOSE
ORDERS
AT
ONE
FRANC
JUST
ONE
FRANC
ABOUT
CENTS
THIS
DOESN
T
SEEM
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
FREE
BUT
IT
WAS
IN
FACT
WHEN
AMAZON
CHANGED
THE
PROMOTION
IN
FRANCE
TO
INCLUDE
FREE
SHIPPING
FRANCE
JOINED
ALL
THE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
A
DRAMATIC
SALES
INCREASE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WHEREAS
SHIPPING
FOR
ONE
FRANC
A
REAL
BARGAIN
WAS
VIRTU
ALLY
IGNORED
BY
THE
FRENCH
FREE
SHIPPING
CAUSED
AN
ENTHU
SIASTIC
RESPONSE
AMERICA
ONLINE
AOL
HAD
A
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
IT
SWITCHED
FROM
PAY
PER
HOUR
SERVICE
TO
A
MONTHLY
PAYMENT
SCHEDULE
IN
WHICH
YOU
COULD
LOG
IN
AS
MANY
HOURS
AS
YOU
WANTED
FOR
A
FIXED
PER
MONTH
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
THE
NEW
PRICE
STRUCTURE
AOL
GEARED
UP
FOR
WHAT
IT
ESTIMATED
WOULD
BE
A
SMALL
INCREASE
IN
DEMAND
WHAT
DID
IT
GET
AN
OVERNIGHT
INCREASE
FROM
TO
CUSTOMERS
LOGGING
INTO
THE
SYSTEM
AND
A
DOUBLING
OF
THE
AVERAGE
TIME
ONLINE
THAT
MAY
SEEM
GOOD
BUT
IT
WASN
T
GOOD
AOL
CUSTOMERS
ENCOUNTERED
BUSY
PHONE
LINES
AND
SOON
AOL
WAS
FORCED
TO
LEASE
SERVICES
FROM
OTHER
ONLINE
PROVIDERS
WHO
WERE
ONLY
TOO
HAPPY
TO
SELL
BANDWIDTH
TO
AOL
AT
THE
PREMIUM
OF
SNOW
SHOVELS
IN
A
SNOWSTORM
WHAT
BOB
PITTMAN
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
AOL
AT
THE
TIME
DIDN
T
REALIZE
WAS
THAT
CONSUMERS
WOULD
RESPOND
TO
THE
ALLURE
OF
FREE
LIKE
STARVING
PEOPLE
AT
A
BUFFET
WHEN
CHOOSING
BETWEEN
TWO
PRODUCTS
THEN
WE
OFTEN
OVERREACT
TO
THE
FREE
ONE
WE
MIGHT
OPT
FOR
A
FREE
CHECKING
ACCOUNT
WITH
NO
BENEFITS
ATTACHED
RATHER
THAN
ONE
THAT
COSTS
FIVE
DOLLARS
A
MONTH
BUT
IF
THE
FIVE
DOLLAR
CHECKING
ACCOUNT
INCLUDES
FREE
TRAVELER
CHECKS
ONLINE
BILLING
ETC
AND
THE
FREE
ONE
DOESN
T
WE
MAY
END
UP
SPENDING
MORE
FOR
THIS
PACKAGE
OF
SERVICES
WITH
THE
FREE
ACCOUNT
THAN
WITH
THE
FIVE
DOLLAR
ACCOUNT
SIMILARLY
WE
MIGHT
CHOOSE
A
MORTGAGE
WITH
NO
CLOSING
COSTS
BUT
WITH
INTEREST
RATES
AND
FEES
THAT
ARE
OFF
THE
WALL
AND
WE
MIGHT
GET
A
PRODUCT
WE
DON
T
REALLY
WANT
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
COMES
WITH
A
FREE
GIFT
MY
MOST
RECENT
PERSONAL
ENCOUNTER
WITH
THIS
INVOLVED
A
CAR
WHEN
I
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
A
NEW
CAR
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
I
KNEW
THAT
I
REALLY
SHOULD
BUY
A
MINIVAN
IN
FACT
I
HAD
READ
UP
ON
HONDA
MINIVANS
AND
KNEW
ALL
ABOUT
THEM
BUT
THEN
AN
AUDI
CAUGHT
MY
EYE
AT
FIRST
THROUGH
AN
APPEALING
OFFER
FREE
OIL
CHANGES
FOR
THE
NEXT
THREE
YEARS
HOW
COULD
I
RESIST
TO
BE
PERFECTLY
HONEST
THE
AUDI
WAS
SPORTY
AND
RED
AND
I
WAS
STILL
RESISTING
THE
IDEA
OF
BEING
A
MATURE
AND
RESPONSIBLE
FATHER
TO
TWO
YOUNG
KIDS
IT
WASN
T
AS
IF
THE
FREE
OIL
CHANGE
COMPLETELY
SWAYED
ME
BUT
ITS
INFLUENCE
ON
ME
WAS
FROM
A
RATIONAL
PERSPECTIVE
UNJUSTIFIABLY
LARGE
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
FREE
IT
SERVED
AS
AN
ADDITIONAL
ALLURE
THAT
I
COULD
CLING
TO
SO
I
BOUGHT
THE
AUDI
AND
THE
FREE
OIL
A
FEW
MONTHS
LATER
WHILE
I
WAS
DRIVING
ON
A
HIGHWAY
THE
TRANSMISSION
BROKE
BUT
THAT
IS
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
OF
COURSE
WITH
A
COOLER
HEAD
I
MIGHT
HAVE
MADE
A
MORE
RATIONAL
CALCULATION
I
DRIVE
ABOUT
MILES
A
YEAR
THE
OIL
NEEDS
TO
BE
CHANGED
EVERY
MILES
AND
THE
COST
PER
CHANGE
IS
ABOUT
OVER
THREE
YEARS
THEN
I
WOULD
SAVE
ABOUT
OR
ABOUT
PERCENT
OF
THE
PURCHASE
PRICE
OF
THE
CAR
NOT
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
BASE
MY
DECISION
ON
IT
GETS
WORSE
THOUGH
NOW
I
HAVE
AN
AUDI
THAT
IS
PACKED
TO
THE
CEILING
WITH
ACTION
FIGURES
A
STROLLER
A
BIKE
AND
OTHER
KIDS
PARAPHERNALIA
OH
FOR
A
MINIVAN
THE
CONCEPT
OF
ZERO
ALSO
APPLIES
TO
TIME
TIME
SPENT
ON
ONE
ACTIVITY
AFTER
ALL
IS
TIME
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
ANOTHER
SO
IF
WE
SPEND
MINUTES
IN
A
LINE
WAITING
FOR
OUR
TURN
TO
GET
A
FREE
TASTE
OF
ICE
CREAM
OR
IF
WE
SPEND
HALF
AN
HOUR
FILLING
OUT
A
LONG
FORM
FOR
A
TINY
REBATE
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
ELSE
THAT
WE
ARE
NOT
DOING
WITH
OUR
TIME
MY
FAVORITE
PERSONAL
EXAMPLE
IS
FREE
ENTRANCE
DAY
AT
A
MUSEUM
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
MOST
MUSEUMS
ARE
NOT
VERY
EXPENSIVE
I
FIND
IT
MUCH
MORE
APPEALING
TO
SATISFY
MY
DESIRE
FOR
ART
WHEN
THE
PRICE
IS
ZERO
OF
COURSE
I
AM
NOT
ALONE
IN
THIS
DESIRE
SO
ON
THESE
DAYS
I
USUALLY
FIND
THAT
THE
MUSEUM
IS
OVERCROWDED
THE
LINE
IS
LONG
IT
IS
HARD
TO
SEE
ANYTHING
AND
FIGHTING
THE
CROWDS
AROUND
THE
MUSEUM
AND
IN
THE
CAFETERIA
IS
UNPLEASANT
DO
I
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
A
MISTAKE
TO
GO
TO
A
MU
SEUM
WHEN
IT
IS
FREE
YOU
BET
I
DO
BUT
I
GO
NEVERTHELESS
ZERO
MAYALSO
AFFECT
FOOD
PURCHASES
FOOD
MANUFACTURERS
HAVE
TO
CONVEY
ALL
KINDS
OF
INFORMATION
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BOX
THEY
HAVE
TO
TELL
US
ABOUT
THE
CALORIES
FAT
CONTENT
FIBER
ETC
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
SAME
ATTRACTION
WE
HAVE
TO
ZERO

COULD
ALSO
APPLY
TO

ZERO

IF
THE

APPLY
PEPSI
WILL

IF
THE

THAN
IF
IT
SAYS
ONE

SUPPOSE
YOU
ARE
AT
A
BAR
ENJOYING
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
SOME
FRIENDS
WITH
ONE
BRAND
YOU
GET
A
CALORIE
FREE
BEER
AND
WITH
ANOTHER
YOU
GET
A
THREE
CALORIE
BEER
WHICH
BRAND
WILL
MAKE
YOU
FEEL
THAT
YOU
ARE
DRINKING
A
REALLY
LIGHT
BEER
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
BEERS
IS
NEGLIGIBLE
THE
ZERO
CALORIE
BEER
WILL
INCREASE
THE
FEELING
THAT
YOU
RE
DOING
THE
RIGHT
THING
HEALTHWISE
YOU
MIGHT
EVEN
FEEL
SO
GOOD
THAT
YOU
GO
AHEAD
AND
ORDER
A
PLATE
OF
FRIES
SO
YOU
CAN
MAINTAIN
THE
STATUS
QUO
WITH
A
CENT
FEE
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AMAZON
SHIPPING
IN
FRANCE
OR
YOU
CAN
START
A
STAMPEDE
BY
OFFERING
SOMETHING
FREE
THINK
HOW
POWERFUL
THAT
IDEA
IS
ZERO
IS
NOT
JUST
ANOTHER
DISCOUNT
ZERO
IS
A
DIF
FERENT
PLACE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
TWO
CENTS
AND
ONE
CENT
IS
SMALL
BUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
ONE
CENT
AND
ZERO
IS
HUGE
IF
YOU
ARE
IN
BUSINESS
AND
UNDERSTAND
THAT
YOU
CAN
DO
SOME
MARVELOUS
THINGS
WANT
TO
DRAW
A
CROWD
MAKE
SOME
THING
FREE
WANT
TO
SELL
MORE
PRODUCTS
MAKE
PART
OF
THE

SIMILARLY
WE
CAN

SOCIAL

WANT
PEOPLE
TO

ELECTRIC

DON
T
JUST
LOWER
THE

ELIMINATE

SO
THAT
YOU
HAVE

IN
THE

WAY
IF

FOCUS
ON

AS
A

BY

I
DON

REALIZE
THAT

IS
AN

IN

LET
ALONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
PLAY
IT
IT
CER
TAINLY
COUNTERINTUITIVE
IN
THESE
TIMES
OF
BUDGET
CUTBACKS
TO
MAKE
SOMETHING
FREE
BUT
WHEN
WE
STOP
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT

CAN
HAVE
A
GREAT
DEAL

AND
IT
MAKES
A
LOT
OF
SENSE
APPENDIX
CHAPTER
LET
ME
EXPLAIN
HOW
THE
LOGIC
OF
STANDARD
ECONOMIC
THEORY
WOULD
APPLY
TO
OUR
SETTING
WHEN
A
PERSON
CAN
SELECT
ONE
AND
ONLY
ONE
OF
TWO
CHOCOLATES
HE
NEEDS
TO
CONSIDER
NOT
THE
AB
SOLUTE
VALUE
OF
EACH
CHOCOLATE
BUT
ITS
RELATIVE
VALUE
WHAT
HE
GETS
AND
WHAT
HE
GIVES
UP
AS
A
FIRST
STEP
THE
RATIONAL
CON
SUMER
NEEDS
TO
COMPUTE
THE
RELATIVE
NET
BENEFITS
OF
THE
TWO
CHOCOLATES
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
EXPECTED
TASTE
MINUS
THE
COST
AND
MAKE
A
DECISION
BASED
ON
WHICH
CHOCOLATE
HAS
THE
LARGER
NET
BENEFIT
HOW
WOULD
THIS
LOOK
WHEN
THE
COST
OF
THE
LINDT
TRUFFLE
WAS
CENTS
AND
THE
COST
OF
THE
HERSHEY
KISS
WAS
ONE
CENT
THE
RATIONAL
CONSUMER
WOULD
ESTIMATE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
PLEASURE
HE
EXPECTS
TO
GET
FROM
THE
TRUFFLE
AND
THE
KISS
LET
SAY
THIS
IS
PLEASURE
UNITS
AND
FIVE
PLEASURE
UNITS
RESPEC
TIVELY
AND
SUBTRACT
THE
DISPLEASURE
HE
WOULD
GET
FROM
PAYING
CENTS
AND
ONE
CENT
LET
SAY
THIS
IS
DISPLEASURE
UNITS
AND
ONE
DISPLEASURE
UNIT
RESPECTIVELY
THIS
WOULD
GIVE
HIM
A
TOTAL
EXPECTED
PLEASURE
OF
PLEASURE
UNITS
FOR
THE
TRUFFLE
AND
A
TOTAL
EXPECTED
PLEASURE
OF
FOUR
PLEASURE
UNITS
FOR
THE
KISS
THE
TRUFFLE
LEADS
BY
POINTS
SO
IT
AN
EASY
CHOICE
THE
TRUFFLE
WINS
HANDS
DOWN
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CASE
WHEN
THE
COST
IS
REDUCED
BY
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
FOR
BOTH
PRODUCTS
TRUFFLES
COST
CENTS
AND
THE
KISS
IS
FREE
THE
SAME
LOGIC
APPLIES
THE
TASTE
OF
THE
CHOCOLATES
HAS
NOT
CHANGED
SO
THE
RATIONAL
CONSUMER
WOULD
ESTIMATE
THE
PLEASURE
TO
BE
AND
FIVE
PLEASURE
UNITS
RESPECTIVELY
WHAT
HAS
CHANGED
IS
THE
DISPLEASURE
IN
THIS
SETTING
THE
RATIONAL
CONSUMER
WOULD
HAVE
A
LOWER
LEVEL
OF
DISPLEASURE
FOR
BOTH
CHOCOLATES
BECAUSE
THE
PRICES
HAVE
BEEN
REDUCED
BY
ONE
CENT
AND
ONE
DISPLEASURE
UNIT
HERE
IS
THE
MAIN
POINT
BE
CAUSE
BOTH
PRODUCTS
WERE
DISCOUNTED
BY
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
THEIR
RELATIVE
DIFFERENCE
WOULD
BE
UNCHANGED
THE
TOTAL
EX
PECTED
PLEASURE
FOR
THE
TRUFFLE
WOULD
NOW
BE
PLEASURE
UNITS
AND
THE
TOTAL
EXPECTED
PLEASURE
FOR
THE
KISS
WOULD
NOW
BE
FIVE
PLEASURE
UNITS
THETRUFFLE
LEADS
BY
THE
SAME
POINTS
SO
IT
SHOULD
BE
THE
SAME
EASY
CHOICE
THE
TRUFFLE
WINS
HANDS
DOWN
THIS
IS
HOW
THE
PATTERN
OF
CHOICE
SHOULD
LOOK
IF
THE
ONLY
FORCES
AT
PLAY
WERE
THOSE
OF
A
RATIONAL
COST
BENEFIT
ANALYSIS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
RESULTS
FROM
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
ARE
SO
DIFFER
ENT
TELLS
US
LOUD
AND
CLEAR
THAT
SOMETHING
ELSE
IS
GOING
ON
AND
THAT
THE
PRICE
OF
ZERO
PLAYS
A
UNIQUE
ROLE
IN
OUR
DECI
SIONS
CHAPTER
THE
COST
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
WHY
WE
ARE
HAPPY
TO
DO
THINGS
BUT
NOT
WHEN
WE
ARE

TO
DO
THEM
OU
ARE

THANKSGIVING

IT

MAY

A

IN

OF
THE

SET
WHAT
GOING

HERE
WHY
DOES
AN

MENT
PUT
SUCH
A
DAMPER
ON
THE
PARTY
AS
MARGARET
CLARK
JUDSON
MILLS
AND
ALAN
FISKE
SUGGESTED
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
THE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
WE
LIVE
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IN
TWO
DIFFERENT
WORLDS
ONEWHERE
SOCIAL
NORMS
PREVAIL
AND
THE
OTHER
WHERE
MARKET
NORMS
MAKE
THE
RULES
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
INCLUDE
THE
FRIENDLY
REQUESTS
THAT
PEOPLE
MAKE
OF
ONE
ANOTHER
COULD
YOU
HELP
ME
MOVE
THIS
COUCH
COULD
YOU
HELP
ME
CHANGE
THIS
TIRE
SOCIAL
NORMS
ARE
WRAPPED
UP
IN
OUR
SOCIAL
NATURE
AND
OUR
NEED
FOR
COMMUNITY
THEY
ARE
USUALLY
WARM
AND
FUZZY
INSTANT
PAY
BACKS
ARE
NOT
REQUIRED
YOU
MAY
HELP
MOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
COUCH
BUT
THIS
DOESN
T
MEAN
HE
HAS
TO
COME
RIGHT
OVER
AND
MOVE
YOURS
IT
LIKE
OPENING
A
DOOR
FOR
SOMEONE
IT
PROVIDES
PLEASURE
FOR
BOTH
OF
YOU
AND
RECIPROCITY
IS
NOT
IMMEDIATELY
REQUIRED
THE
SECOND
WORLD
THE
ONE
GOVERNED
BY
MARKET
NORMS
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
THERE
NOTHING
WARM
AND
FUZZY
ABOUT
IT
THE
EXCHANGES
ARE
SHARP
EDGED
WAGES
PRICES
RENTS
INTEREST
AND
COSTS
AND
BENEFITS
SUCH
MARKET
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
NOT
NECES
SARILY
EVIL
OR
MEAN
IN
FACT
THEY
ALSO
INCLUDE
SELF
RELIANCE
INVENTIVENESS
AND
INDIVIDUALISM
BUT
THEY
DO
IMPLY
COMPA
RABLE
BENEFITS
AND
PROMPT
PAYMENTS
WHEN
YOU
ARE
IN
THE
DOMAIN
OF
MARKET
NORMS
YOU
GET
WHAT
YOU
PAY
FOR
THAT
JUST
THE
WAY
IT
IS
WHEN
WE
KEEP
SOCIAL
NORMS
AND
MARKET
NORMS
ON
THEIR
SEPARATE
PATHS
LIFE
HUMS
ALONG
PRETTY
WELL
TAKE
SEX
FOR
IN
STANCE
WE
MAY
HAVE
IT
FREE
IN
THE
SOCIAL
CONTEXT
WHERE
IT
IS
WE
HOPE
WARM
AND
EMOTIONALLY
NOURISHING
BUT
THERE
ALSO
MARKET
SEX
SEX
THAT
IS
ON
DEMAND
AND
THAT
COSTS
MONEY
THIS
SEEMS
PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD
WE
DON
T
HAVE
HUSBANDS
OR
WIVES
COMING
HOME
ASKING
FOR
A
TRICK
NOR
DO
WE
HAVE
PROSTITUTES
HOPING
FOR
EVERLASTING
LOVE
WHEN
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
COLLIDE
TROUBLE
SETS
IN
TAKE
SEX
AGAIN
A
GUY
TAKES
A
GIRL
OUT
FOR
DINNER
AND
A

AND
HE
PAYS
THE
BILLS
THEY
GO
OUT
AGAIN
AND
HE
PAYS
THE

ONCE
MORE
THEY
GO
OUT
A
THIRD

AND
HE
STILL
SPRINGING
FOR
THE

AT
THIS
POINT
HE
HOPING
FOR
AT

A
PASSIONATE

AT

HIS

PERILOUSLY

MUCH
THIS
ROMANCE
IS
COSTING
HIM
NOW
HE
CROSSED
THE

SHE
CALLS
HIM
A
BEAST
AND
STORMS
OFF
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
THAT
ONE
CAN
T
MIX
SOCIAL
AND

NORMS
ESPECIALLY
IN
THIS
CASE
WITH
OUT
IMPLYING
THAT
THE
LADY
IS
A

HE
SHOULD
ALSO

REMEMBERED
THE
IMMORTAL

A
FEW
YEARS

JAMES
HEYMAN
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVER
SITY
OF
ST
THOMAS
AND
I
DECIDED
TO
EXPLORE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SO
CIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
SIMULATING
THE
THANKSGIVING
INCIDENT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WONDERFUL
BUT
CONSIDERING
THE
DAMAGE
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE
TO
OUR
PARTICIPANT
FAMILY
RELATIONSHIPS
WE
CHOSE
SOMETHING
MORE
MUNDANE
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
BORING
TASKS
WE
COULD
FIND
THERE
IS
A
TRADITION
IN
SOCIAL
SCIENCE
OF
USING
VERY
BORING
TASKS
IN
THIS
EXPERIMENT
A
CIRCLE
WAS
PRESENTED
ON
THE
LEFT
SIDE
OF
A
COMPUTER
SCREEN
AND
A
BOX
WAS
PRESENTED
ON
THE
RIGHT
THE
TASK
WAS
TO
DRAG
THE
CIRCLE
USING
THE
COMPUTER
MOUSE
ONTO
THE
SQUARE
ONCE
THE
CIRCLE
WAS
SUCCESSFULLY
DRAGGED
TO
THE
SQUARE
IT
DISAPPEARED
FROM
THE
SCREEN
AND
A
NEW
CIRCLE
APPEARED
AT
THE
STARTING
POINT
WE
ASKED
THE
PARTICIPANTS
TO
DRAG
AS
MANY
CIRCLES
AS
THEY
COULD
AND
WE
MEASURED
HOW
MANY
CIRCLES
THEY
DRAGGED
WITHIN
FIVE
MINUTES
THIS
WAS
OUR
MEASURE
OF
THEIR
LABOR
OUTPUT
THE
EFFORT
THAT
THEY
WOULD
PUT
INTO
THIS
TASK
HOW
COULD
THIS
SETUP
SHED
LIGHT
ON
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
EX
CHANGES
SOME
OF
THE
PARTICIPANTS
RECEIVED
FIVE
DOLLARS
FOR
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
SHORT
EXPERIMENT
THEY
WERE
GIVEN
THE
MONEY
AS
THEY
WALKED
INTO
THE
LAB
AND
THEY
WERE
TOLD
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
FIVE
MINUTES
THE
COMPUTER
WOULD
ALERT
THEM
THAT
THE
TASK
WAS
DONE
AT
WHICH
POINT
THEY
WERE
TO
LEAVE
THE
LAB
BECAUSE
WE
PAID
THEM
FOR
THEIR
EFFORTS
WE
EXPECTED
THEM
TO
APPLY
MARKET
NORMS
TO
THIS
SITUATION
AND
ACT
ACCORDINGLY
PARTICIPANTS
IN
A
SECOND
GROUP
WERE
PRESENTED
WITH
THE
SAME
BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS
AND
TASK
BUT
FOR
THEM
THE
REWARD
WAS
MUCH
LOWER
CENTS
IN
ONE
EXPERIMENT
AND
CENTS
IN
THE
OTHER
AGAIN
WE
EXPECTED
THE
PARTICIPANTS
TO
APPLY
MAR
KET
NORMS
TO
THIS
SITUATION
AND
ACT
ACCORDINGLY
FINALLY
WE
HAD
A
THIRD
GROUP
TO
WHOM
WE
INTRODUCED
THE
TASKS
AS
A
SOCIAL
REQUEST
WE
DIDN
T
OFFER
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THIS
GROUP
ANYTHING
CONCRETE
IN
RETURN
FOR
THEIR
EFFORT
NOR
DID
WE
MENTION
MONEY
IT
WAS
MERELY
A
FAVOR
THAT
WE
ASKED
OF
THEM
WE
EXPECTED
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
TO
APPLY
SOCIAL
NORMS
TO
THE
SITUATION
AND
ACT
ACCORDINGLY
HOW
HARD
DID
THE
DIFFERENT
GROUPS
WORK
IN
LINE
WITH
THE
ETHOS
OF
MARKET
NORMS
THOSE
WHO
RECEIVED
FIVE
DOLLARS
DRAGGED
ON
AVERAGE
CIRCLES
AND
THOSE
WHO
RECEIVED
CENTS
DRAGGED
ON
AVERAGE
CIRCLES
AS
EXPECTED
MORE
MONEY
CAUSED
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
TO
BE
MORE
MOTIVATED
AND
WORK
HARDER
BY
ABOUT
PERCENT
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CONDITION
WITH
NO
MONEY
DID
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
WORK
LESS
THAN
THE
ONES
WHO
GOT
THE
LOW
MON
ETARY
PAYMENT
OR
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
MONEY
DID
THEY
APPLY
SOCIAL
NORMS
TO
THE
SITUATION
AND
WORK
HARDER
THE
RESULTS
SHOWED
THAT
ON
AVERAGE
THEY
DRAGGED
CIRCLES
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THOSE
WHO
WERE
PAID
CENTS
AND
JUST
SLIGHTLY
MORE
THAN
THOSE
WHO
WERE
PAID
FIVE
DOLLARS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
WORKED
HARDER
UNDER
THE
NONMONETARY
SOCIAL
NORMS
THAN
FOR
THE
ALMIGHTY
BUCK
OK
CENTS
PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
ANTICIPATED
THIS
THERE
ARE
MANY
EXAMPLES
TO
SHOW
THAT
PEOPLE
WILL
WORK
MORE
FOR
A
CAUSE
THAN
FOR
CASH
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
AARP
ASKED
SOME
LAWYERS
IF
THEY
WOULD
OFFER
LESS
EXPENSIVE
SERVICES
TO
NEEDY
RETIREES
AT
SOMETHING
LIKE
AN
HOUR
THE
LAWYERS
SAID
NO
THEN
THE
PROGRAM
MANAGER
FROM
AARP
HAD
A
BRILLIANT
IDEA
HE
ASKED
THE
LAWYERS
IF
THEY
WOULD
OFFER
FREE
SERVICES
TO
NEEDY
RETIREES
OVERWHELMINGLY
THE
LAWYERS
SAID
YES
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
HERE
HOW
COULD
ZERO
DOLLARS
BE
MORE
ATTRACTIVE
THAN
WHEN
MONEY
WAS
MENTIONED
THE
LAW
YERS
USED
MARKET
NORMS
AND
FOUND
THE
OFFER
LACKING
RELATIVE
TO
THEIR
MARKET
SALARY
WHEN
NO
MONEY
WAS
MENTIONED
THEY
USED
SOCIAL
NORMS
AND
WERE
WILLING
TO
VOLUNTEER
THEIR
TIME
WHY
DIDN
T
THEY
JUST
ACCEPT
THE
THINKING
OF
THEMSELVES
AS
VOLUNTEERS
WHO
RECEIVED
BECAUSE
ONCE
MARKET
NORMS
ENTER
OUR
CONSIDERATIONS
THE

DEPART
A
SIMILAR
LESSON
WAS
LEARNED
BY
N
ACHUM
SICHERMAN
AN
ECONOMICS
PROFESSOR
AT
COLUMBIA
WHO
WAS
TAKING
MARTIAL
ARTS
LESSONS
IN
JAPAN
THE
SENSEI
THE
MASTER
TEACHER
WAS
NOT
CHARGING
THE
GROUP
FOR
THE
TRAINING
THE
STUDENTS
FEELING
THAT
THIS
WAS
UNFAIR
APPROACHED
THE
MASTER
ONE
DAY
AND
SUG
GESTED
THAT
THEY
PAY
HIM
FOR
HIS
TIME
AND
EFFORT
SETTING
DOWN
HIS
BAMBOO
SHINAI
THE
MASTER
CALMLY
REPLIED
THAT
IF
HE
CHARGED
THEM
THEY
WOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
AFFORD
HIM
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
EXPERIMENT
THEN
THOSE
WHO
GOT
PAID
CENTS
DIDN
T
SAY
TO
THEMSELVES
GOOD
FOR
ME
I
GET
TO
DO
THIS
FAVOR
FOR
THESE
RESEARCHERS
AND
I
AM
GETTING
SOME
MONEY
OUT
OF
THIS
AND
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
HARDER
THAN
THOSE
WHO
WERE
PAID
NOTHING
INSTEAD
THEY
SWITCHED
THEMSELVES
OVER
TO
THE
MARKET
NORMS
DECIDED
THAT
CENTS
WASN
T
MUCH
AND
WORKED
HALFHEARTEDLY
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WHEN
THE
MARKET
NORMS
ENTERED
THE
LAB
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
WERE
PUSHED
OUT
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
WE
REPLACED
THE
PAYMENTS
WITH
A
GIFT
SURELY
YOUR
MOTHER
IN
LAW
WOULD
ACCEPT
A
GOOD
BOTTLE
OF
WINE
AT
DINNER
OR
HOW
ABOUT
A
HOUSEWARMING
PRESENT
SUCH
AS
AN
ECO
FRIENDLY
PLANT
FOR
A
FRIEND
ARE
GIFTS
METHODS
OF
EXCHANGE
THAT
KEEP
US
WITHIN
THE
SOCIAL
EXCHANGE
NORMS
WOULD
PARTICIPANTS
RECEIVING
SUCH
GIFTS
SWITCH
OUT
OF
THE
SO
CIAL
NORMS
AND
INTO
MARKET
NORMS
OR
WOULD
OFFERING
GIFTS
AS
REWARDS
MAINTAIN
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
SOCIAL
WORLD
TO
FIND
OUT
JUST
WHERE
GIFTS
FALL
ON
THE
LINE
BETWEEN
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
JAMES
AND
I
DECIDED
ON
A
NEW
EXPERI
MENT
THIS
TIME
WE
DIDN
T
OFFER
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
MONEY
FOR
DRAGGING
CIRCLES
ACROSS
A
COMPUTER
SCREEN
WE
OFFERED
THEM
GIFTS
INSTEAD
WE
REPLACED
THE
CENT
REWARD
WITH
A
SNICKERS
BAR
WORTH
ABOUT
CENTS
AND
THE
FIVE
DOLLAR
INCENTIVE
WITH
A
BOX
OF
GODIVA
CHOCOLATES
WORTH
ABOUT
FIVE
DOLLARS
THE
PARTICIPANTS
CAME
TO
THE
LAB
GOT
THEIR
REWARD
WORKED
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
LIKED
AND
LEFT
THEN
WE
LOOKED
AT
THE
RESULTS
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
ALL
THREE
EXPERIMENTAL
GROUPS
WORKED
ABOUT
EQUALLY
HARD
DURING
THE
TASK
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
GOT
A
SMALL
SNICKERS
BAR
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
DRAGGED
ON
AVERAGE
CIRCLES
THE
GODIVA
CHOCOLATES
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
DRAGGED
ON
AVERAGE
CIRCLES
OR
NOTHING
AT
ALL
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
DRAGGED
ON
AVERAGE
CIRCLES
THE
CONCLUSION
NO
ONE
IS
OFFENDED
BY
A
SMALL
GIFT
BECAUSE
EVEN
SMALL
GIFTS
KEEP
US
IN
THE
SOCIAL
EXCHANGE
WORLD
AND
AWAY
FROM
MARKET
NORMS
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
WE
MIXED
THE
SIGNALS
FOR
THE
TWO
TYPES
OF
NORMS
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
WE
BLENDED
THE
MARKET
NORM
WITH
THE
SOCIAL
NORM
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
WE
SAID
THAT
WE
WOULD
GIVE
THEM
A
SO
CENT
SNICKERS
BAR
OR
A
FIVE
DOLLAR
BOX
OF
GODIVA
CHOCOLATES
WHAT
WOULD
THE
PARTICI
PANTS
DO
WOULD
A
CENT
SNICKERS
BAR
MAKE
OUR
PARTICIPANTS
WORK
AS
HARD
AS
A
SNICKERS
BAR
MADE
THEM
WORK
OR
WOULD
IT
MAKE
THEM
WORK
HALFHEARTEDLY
AS
THE
SO
CENTS
MADE
THEM
WORK
OR
WOULD
IT
BE
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
THE
NEXT
EXPERIMENT
TESTED
THESE
IDEAS
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
THE
PARTICIPANTS
WERE
NOT
MOTIVATED
TO
WORK
AT
ALL
WHEN
THEY
GOT
THE
CENT
SNICKERS
BAR
AND
IN
FACT
THE
EFFORT
THEY
INVESTED
WAS
THE
SAME
AS
WHEN
THEY
GOT
A
PAYMENT
OF
CENTS
THEY
REACTED
TO
THE
EXPLICITLY
PRICED
GIFT
IN
EXACTLY
THE
WAY
THEY
REACTED
TO
CASH
AND
THE
GIFT
NO
LONGER
INVOKED
SOCIAL
NORMS
BY
THE
MENTION
OF
ITS
COST
THE
GIFT
HAD
PASSED
INTO
THE
REALM
OF
MARKET
NORMS
BY
THE
WAY
WE
REPLICATED
THE
SETUP
LATER
WHEN
WE
ASKED
PASSERSBY
WHETHER
THEY
WOULD
HELP
US
UNLOAD
A
SOFA
FROM
A
TRUCK
WE
FOUND
THE
SAME
RESULTS
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
WORK
FREE
AND
THEY
ARE
WILLING
TO
WORK
FOR
A
REASONABLE
WAGE
BUT
OFFER
THEM
JUST
A
SMALL
PAYMENT
AND
THEY
WILL
WALK
AWAY
GIFTS
ARE
ALSO
EFFECTIVE
FOR
SOFAS
AND
OFFERING
PEOPLE
A
GIFT
EVEN
A
SMALL
ONE
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
GET
THEM
TO
HELP
BUT
MEN
TION
WHAT
THE
GIFT
COST
YOU
AND
YOU
WILL
SEE
THE
BACK
OF
THEM
FASTER
THAN
YOU
CAN
SAY
MARKET
NORMS
THESE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
FOR
MARKET
NORMS
TO
EMERGE
IT
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
MENTION
MONEY
EVEN
WHEN
NO
MONEY
CHANGES
HANDS
BUT
OF
COURSE
MARKET
NORMS
ARE
NOT
JUST
ABOUT
EFFORT
THEY
RELATE
TO
A
BROAD
RANGE
OF
BEHAVIORS
INCLUDING
SELF
RELIANCE
HELPING
AND
INDIVIDUALISM
WOULD
SIMPLY
GET
TING
PEOPLE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
MONEY
INFLUENCE
THEM
TO
BEHAVE
DIFFERENTLY
IN
THESE
RESPECTS
THIS
PREMISE
WAS
EXPLORED
IN
A
SET
OF
FANTASTIC
EXPERIMENTS
BY
KATHLEEN
VOHS
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
MINNESOTA
NICOLE
MEAD
A
GRADUATE
STU
DENT
AT
FLORIDA
STATE
UNIVERSITY
AND
MIRANDA
GOODE
A
GRADUATE
STUDENT
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
THEY
ASKED
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THEIR
EXPERIMENTS
TO
COM
PLETE
A
SCRAMBLED
SENTENCE
TASK
THAT
IS
TO
REARRANGE
SETS
OF
WORDS
TO
FORM
SENTENCES
FOR
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
ONE
GROUP
THE
TASK
WAS
BASED
ON
NEUTRAL
SENTENCES
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
COLD
OUTSIDE
FOR
THE
OTHER
GROUP
THE
TASK
WAS
BASED
ON
SENTENCES
OR
PHRASES
RELATED
TO
MONEY
FOR
EXAMPLE
HIGH
PAYING
SALARY
WOULD
THINKING
ABOUT
MONEY
IN
THIS
MAN
NER
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
CHANGE
THE
WAY
PARTICIPANTS
BEHAVE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTS
THE
PARTICIPANTS
FINISHED
THE
UNSCRAMBLING
TASK
AND
WERE
THEN
GIVEN
A
DIFFICULT
PUZZLE
IN
WHICH
THEY
HAD
TO
ARRANGE
DISKS
INTO
A
SQUARE
AS
THE
EX
PERIMENTER
LEFT
THE
ROOM
HE
TOLD
THEM
THAT
THEY
COULD
COME
TO
HIM
IF
THEY
NEEDED
ANY
HELP
WHO
DO
YOU
THINK
ASKED
FOR
THIS
GENERAL
PROCEDURE
IS
CALLED
PRIMING
AND
THE
UNSCRAMBLING
TASK
IS
USED
TO
GET
PARTICIPANTS
TO
THINK
ABOUT
A
PARTICULAR
TOPIC
WITHOUT
DIRECT
INSTRUCTIONS
TO
DO
SO
HELP
SOONER
THOSE
WHO
HAD
WORKED
ON
THE
SALARY
SEN
TENCES
WITH
THEIR
IMPLICIT
SUGGESTION
OF
MONEY
OR
THOSE
WHO
HAD
WORKED
ON
THE
NEUTRAL
SENTENCES
ABOUT
THE
WEATHER
AND
OTHER
SUCH
TOPICS
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
THE
STUDENTS
WHO
HAD
FIRST
WORKED
ON
THE
SALARY
TASK
STRUGGLED
WITH
THE
PUZZLE
FOR
ABOUT
FIVE
AND
A
HALF
MINUTES
BEFORE
ASKING
FOR
HELP
WHEREAS
THOSE
WHO
HAD
FIRST
WORKED
ON
THE
NEUTRAL
TASK
ASKED
FOR
HELP
AFTER
ABOUT
THREE
MINUTES
THINKING
ABOUT
MONEY
THEN
MADE
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
SALARY
GROUP
MORE
SELF
RELIANT
AND
LESS
WILLING
TO
ASK
FOR
HELP
BUT
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
WERE
ALSO
LESS
WILLING
TO
HELP
OTH
ERS
IN
FACT
AFTER
THINKING
ABOUT
MONEY
THESE
PARTICIPANTS
WERE
LESS
WILLING
TO
HELP
AN
EXPERIMENTER
ENTER
DATA
LESS
LIKELY
TO
ASSIST
ANOTHER
PARTICIPANT
WHO
SEEMED
CONFUSED
AND
LESS
LIKELY
TO
HELP
A
STRANGER
AN
EXPERIMENTER
IN
DIS
GUISE
WHO
ACCIDENTALLY
SPILLED
A
BOX
OF
PENCILS
OVERALL
THE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
SALARY
GROUP
SHOWED
MANY
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
MARKET
THEY
WERE
MORE
SELFISH
AND
SELF
RELIANT
THEY
WANTED
TO
SPEND
MORE
TIME
ALONE
THEY
WERE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
SELECT
TASKS
THAT
REQUIRED
INDIVIDUAL
INPUT
RATHER
THAN
TEAMWORK
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DECIDING
WHERE
THEY
WANTED
TO
SIT
THEY
CHOSE
SEATS
FARTHER
AWAY
FROM
WHOMEVER
THEY
WERE
TOLD
TO
WORK
WITH
INDEED
JUST
THINKING
ABOUT
MONEY
MAKES
US
BEHAVE
AS
MOST
ECONOMISTS
BELIEVE
WE
BEHAVE
AND
LESS
LIKE
THE
SOCIAL
ANIMALS
WE
ARE
IN
OUR
DAILY
LIVES
THIS
LEADS
ME
TO
A
FINAL
THOUGHT
WHEN
YOU
RE
IN
A
RESTAU
RANT
WITH
A
DATE
FOR
HEAVEN
SAKE
DON
T
MENTION
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
SELECTIONS
YES
THEY
RE
PRINTED
CLEARLY
ON
THE
MENU
YES
THIS
MIGHT
BE
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
IMPRESS
YOUR
DATE
WITH
THE
CALIBER
OF
THE
RESTAURANT
BUT
IF
YOU
RUB
IT
IN
YOU
LL
BE
LIKELY
TO
SHIFT
YOUR
RELATIONSHIP
FROM
THE
SOCIAL
TO
THE
MARKET
NORM
YES
YOUR
DATE
MAY
FAIL
TO
RECOGNIZE
HOW
MUCH
THIS
MEAL
IS
SETTING
YOU
BACK
YES
YOUR
MOTHER
IN
LAW
MAY
ASSUME
THAT
THE
BOTTLE
OF
WINE
YOU
VE
PRESENTED
IS
A
BLEND
WHEN
IT
A
SPECIAL
RESERVE
MERLOT
THAT
THE
PRICE
YOU
HAVE
TO
PAY
THOUGH
TO
KEEP
YOUR
RELATIONSHIPS
IN
THE
SOCIAL
DOMAIN
AND
AWAY
FROM
MARKET
NORMS
SO
WE
LJVE
IN
TWO
WORLDS
ONE
CHARACTERIZED
BY
SOCIAL
EX
CHANGES
AND
THE
OTHER
CHARACTERIZED
BY
MARKET
EXCHANGES
AND
WE
APPLY
DIFFERENT
NORMS
TO
THESE
TWO
KINDS
OF
RELATION
SHIPS
MOREOVER
INTRODUCING
MARKET
NORMS
INTO
SOCIAL
EX
CHANGES
AS
WE
HAVE
SEEN
VIOLATES
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
AND
HURTS
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
ONCE
THIS
TYPE
OF
MISTAKE
HAS
BEEN
COM
MITTED
RECOVERING
A
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIP
IS
DIFFICULT
ONCE
YOU
VE
OFFERED
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
DELIGHTFUL
THANKSGIVING
DINNER
YOUR
MOTHER
IN
LAW
WILL
REMEMBER
THE
INCIDENT
FOR
YEARS
TO
COME
AND
IF
YOU
VE
EVER
OFFERED
A
POTENTIAL
ROMANTIC
PARTNER
THE
CHANCE
TO
CUT
TO
THE
CHASE
SPLIT
THE
COST
OF
THE
COURTING
PROCESS
AND
SIMPLY
GO
TO
BED
THE
ODDS
ARE
THAT
YOU
WILL
HAVE
WRECKED
THE
ROMANCE
FOREVER
MY
GOOD
FRIENDS
URI
GNEEZY
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
CALIFORNIA
AT
SAN
DIEGO
AND
ALDO
RUSTICHINI
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
MINNESOTA
PROVIDED
A
VERY
CLEVER
TEST
OF
THE
LONG
TERM
EFFECTS
OF
A
SWITCH
FROM
SOCIAL
TO
MARKET
NORMS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THEY
STUDIED
A
DAY
CARE
CENTER
IN
ISRAEL
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
IMPOSING
A
FINE
ON
PARENTS
WHO
ARRIVED
LATE
TO
PICK
UP
THEIR
CHILDREN
WAS
A
USEFUL
DETERRENT
URI
AND
ALDO
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
FINE
DIDN
T
WORK
WELL
AND
IN
FACT
IT
HAD
LONG
TERM
NEGATIVE
EFFECTS
WHY
BEFORE
THE
FINE
WAS
IN
TRODUCED
THE
TEACHERS
AND
PARENTS
HAD
A
SOCIAL
CONTRACT
WITH
SOCIAL
NORMS
ABOUT
BEING
LATE
THUS
IF
PARENTS
WERE
LATE
AS
THEY
OCCASIONALLY
WERE
THEY
FELT
GUILTY
ABOUT
IT
AND
THEIR
GUILT
COMPELLED
THEM
TO
BE
MORE
PROMPT
IN
PICKING
UP
THEIR
KIDS
IN
THE
FUTURE
IN
ISRAEL
GUILT
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
EFFECTIVE
WAY
TO
GET
COMPLIANCE
BUT
ONCE
THE
FINE
WAS
IMPOSED
THE
DAY
CARE
CENTER
HAD
INADVERTENTLY
REPLACED
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
WITH
MARKET
NORMS
NOW
THAT
THE
PARENTS
WERE
PAYING
FOR
THEIR
TARDINESS
THEY
INTERPRETED
THE
SITUATION
IN
TERMS
OF
MAR
KET
NORMS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
SINCE
THEY
WERE
BEING
FINED
THEY
COULD
DECIDE
FOR
THEMSELVES
WHETHER
TO
BE
LATE
OR
NOT
AND
THEY
FREQUENTLY
CHOSE
TO
BE
LATE
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THIS
WAS
NOT
WHAT
THE
DAY
CARE
CENTER
INTENDED
BUT
THE
REAL
STORY
ONLY
STARTED
HERE
THE
MOST
INTERESTING
PART
OCCURRED
A
FEW
WEEKS
LATER
WHEN
THE
DAY
CARE
CENTER
RE
MOVED
THE
FINE
NOW
THE
CENTER
WAS
BACK
TO
THE
SOCIAL
NORM
WOULD
THE
PARENTS
ALSO
RETURN
TO
THE
SOCIAL
NORM
WOULD
THEIR
GUILT
RETURN
AS
WELL
NOT
AT
ALL
ONCE
THE
FINE
WAS
REMOVED
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
PARENTS
DIDN
T
CHANGE
THEY
CONTINUED
TO
PICK
UP
THEIR
KIDS
LATE
IN
FACT
WHEN
THE
FINE
WAS
REMOVED
THERE
WAS
A
SLIGHT
INCREASE
IN
THE
NUMBER
OF
TARDY
PICKUPS
AFTER
ALL
BOTH
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
AND
THE
FINE
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
THIS
EXPERIMENT
ILLUSTRATES
AN
UNFORTUNATE
FACT
WHEN
A
SO
CIAL
NORM
COLLIDES
WITH
A
MARKET
NORM
THE
SOCIAL
NORM
GOES
AWAY
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
IN
OTHER
WORDS
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
NOT
EASY
TO
REESTABLISH
ONCE
THE
BLOOM
IS
OFF
THE
ROSE
ONCE
A
SO
CIAL
NORM
IS
TRUMPED
BY
A
MARKET
NORM
IT
WILL
RARELY
RETURN
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
LIVE
IN
BOTH
THE
SOCIAL
WORLD
AND
THE
MAR
KET
WORLD
HAS
MANY
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
OUR
PERSONAL
LIVES
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WE
ALL
NEED
SOMEONE
TO
HELP
US
MOVE
SOMETHING
OR
TO
WATCH
OUR
KIDS
FOR
A
FEW
HOURS
OR
TO
TAKE
IN
OUR
MAIL
WHEN
WE
RE
OUT
OF
TOWN
WHAT
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
MOTIVATE
OUR
FRIENDS
AND
NEIGHBORS
TO
HELP
US
WOULD
CASH
DO
IT
A
GIFT
PERHAPS
HOW
MUCH
OR
NOTHING
AT
ALL
THIS
SOCIAL
DANCE
AS
I
M
SURE
YOU
KNOW
ISN
T
EASY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THERE
A
RISK
OF
PUSHING
A
RELATIONSHIP
INTO
THE
REALM
OF
A
MAR
KET
EXCHANGE
HERE
ARE
SOME
ANSWERS
ASKING
A
FRIEND
TO
HELP
MOVE
A
LARGE
PIECE
OF
FURNITURE
OR
A
FEW
BOXES
IS
FINE
BUT
ASKING
A
FRIEND
TO
HELP
MOVE
A
LOT
OF
BOXES
OR
FURNITURE
IS
NOT
ESPE
CIALLY
IF
THE
FRIEND
IS
WORKING
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WITH
MOVERS
WHO
ARE
GETTING
PAID
FOR
THE
SAME
TASK
IN
THIS
CASE
YOUR
FRIEND
MIGHT
BEGIN
TO
FEEL
THAT
HE
BEING
USED
SIMILARLY
ASKING
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
WHO
HAPPENS
TO
BE
A
LAWYER
TO
BRING
IN
YOUR
MAIL
WHILE
YOU
RE
ON
VACATION
IS
FINE
BUT
ASKING
HIM
TO
SPEND
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
PREPARING
A
RENTAL
CONTRACT
FOR
YOU
FREE
IS
NOT
THE
DELICATE
BALANCE
BETWEEN
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
IS
ALSO
EVIDENT
IN
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
DECADES
COMPANIES
HAVE
TRIED
TO
MARKET
THEMSELVES
AS
SOCIAL
COMPANIONS
THAT
IS
THEY
D
LIKE
US
TO
THINK
THAT
THEY
AND
WE
ARE
FAMILY

AT

ARE

WHO

IF

SCREWING

EVEN
IMPOSING

RATES
ARE

RELATIONSHIPS
OF

HAVE
UPS
AND
DOWNS
BUT
OVERALL
THEY
RE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
THING
BUT
HERE
WHAT
I
FIND
STRANGE
ALTHOUGH
COMPANIES
HAVE
POURED
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
INTO
MARKETING
AND
ADVERTISING
TO
CREATE
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS
OR
AT
LEAST
AN
IMPRESSION
OF
SO
CIAL
RELATIONSHIPS
THEY
DON
T
SEEM
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
NATURE
OF
A
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIP
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
ITS
RISKS
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
A
CUSTOMER
CHECK
BOUNCES
IF
THE
RELATIONSHIP
IS
BASED
ON
MARKET
NORMS
THE
BANK
CHARGES
A
FEE
AND
THE
CUSTOMER
SHAKES
IT
OFF

IS
BUSINESS
WHILE
THE
FEE
IS
ANNOYING
IT
NONETHELESS
ACCEPT
ABLE
IN
A

RELATIONSHIP
HOWEVER
A
HEFTY
LATE
FEE
RATHER
THAN
A
FRIENDLY
CALL
FROM
THE
MANAGER
OR
AN
AUTOMATIC
FEE
WAIVER
IS
NOT
ONLY
A
RELATIONSHIP
KILLER
IT
A
STAB
IN
THE
BACK
CONSUMERS
WILL
TAKE
PERSONAL
OFFENSE
THEY
LL
LEAVE
THE
BANK
ANGRY
AND
SPEND
HOURS
COMPLAINING
TO
THEIR
FRIENDS
ABOUT
THIS
AWFUL
BANK
AFTER
ALL
THIS
WAS
A
RELATIONSHIP
FRAMED
AS
A
SOCIAL

NO
MATTER
HOW
MANY
COOKIES
SLOGANS
AND
TOKENS
OF
FRIENDSHIP
A
BANK
PROVIDES
ONE
VIOLA
TION
OF
THE
SOCIAL
EXCHANGE
MEANS
THAT
THE
CONSUMER
IS
BACK
TO
THE

IT
CAN
HAPPEN
THAT
QUICKLY
WHAT
THE
UPSHOT
IF
YOU
RE
A
COMPANY
MY
ADVICE
IS
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
YOU
CAN
T
HAVE
IT
BOTH
WAYS
YOU
CAN
T
TREAT
YOUR
CUSTOMERS
LIKE
FAMILY
ONE
MOMENT
AND
THEN
TREAT
THEM
IMPERSONALLY
OR
EVEN
WORSE
AS
A
NUISANCE
OR
A
COMPETITOR
A
MOMENT
LATER
WHEN
THIS
BECOMES
MORE
CONVENIENT
OR
PROFIT
ABLE
THIS
IS
NOT
HOW
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS
WORK
IF
YOU
WANT
A
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIP
GO
FOR
IT
BUT
REMEMBER
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
MAINTAIN
IT
UNDER
ALL
CIRCUMSTANCES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOU
THINK
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
PLAY
TOUGH
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
CHARGING
EXTRA
FOR
ADDITIONAL
SER
VICES
OR
RAPPING
KNUCKLES
SWIFTLY
TO
KEEP
THE
CONSUMERS
IN
LINE
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
WANT
TO
WASTE
MONEY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
ON
MAKING
YOUR
COMPANY
THE
FUZZY
FEEL
GOOD
CHOICE
IN
THAT
CASE
STICK
TO
A
SIMPLE
VALUE
PROPOSITION
STATE
WHAT
YOU
GIVE
AND
WHAT
YOU
EXPECT
IN
RETURN
SINCE
YOU
RE
NOT
SETTING
UP
ANY
SOCIAL
NORMS
OR
EXPECTATIONS
YOU
ALSO
CAN
T
VIOLATE
ANY
AFTER
ALL
IT
JUST
BUSINESS
COMPANIES
HAVE
ALSO
TRIED
TO
ESTABLISH
SOCIAL
NORMS
WITH
THEIR
EMPLOYEES
IT
WASN
T
ALWAYS
THIS
WAY
YEARS
AGO
THE
WORKFORCE
OF
AMERICA
WAS
MORE
OF
AN
INDUSTRIAL
MARKET
DRIVEN
EXCHANGE
BACK
THEN
IT
WAS
OFTEN
A
NINE
TO
FIVE
TIME
CLOCK
KIND
OF
MENTALITY
YOU
PUT
IN
YOUR
HOURS
AND
YOU
GOT
YOUR
PAYCHECK
ON
FRIDAY
SINCE
WORKERS
WERE
PAID
BY
THE
HOUR
THEY
KNEW
EXACTLY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
WORKING
FOR
THE
MAN
AND
WHEN
THEY
WEREN
T
THE
FACTORY
WHISTLE
BLEW
OR
THE
CORPORATE
EQUIVALENT
TOOK
PLACE
AND
THE
TRANSACTION
WAS
FINISHED
THIS
WAS
A
CLEAR
MARKET
EXCHANGE
AND
IT
WORKED
ADEQUATELY
FOR
BOTH
SIDES
TODAY
COMPANIES
SEE
AN
ADVANTAGE
IN
CREATING
A
SOCIAL
EXCHANGE
AFTER
ALL
IN
TODAY
MARKET
WE
RE
THE
MAKERS
OF
INTANGIBLES
CREATIVITY
COUNTS
MORE
THAN
INDUSTRIAL
MACHINES
THE
PARTITION
BETWEEN
WORK
AND
LEISURE
HAS
LIKEWISE
BLURRED
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
RUN
THE
WORKPLACE
WANT
US
TO
THINK
ABOUT
WORK
WHILE
WE
RE
DRIVING
HOME
AND
WHILE
WE
RE
IN
THE
SHOWER
THEY
VE
GIVEN
US
LAPTOPS

AND
BLACKBERRIES
TO
BRIDGE
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
THE
WORKPLACE
AND
HOME
FURTHER
BLURRING
THE
NINE
TO
FIVE
WORKDAY
IS
THE
TREND
IN
MANY
COMPANIES
TO
MOVE
AWAY
FROM
HOURLY
RATES
TO
MONTHLY
PAY
IN
THIS
WORK
ENVIRONMENT
SOCIAL
NORMS
HAVE
A
GREAT
ADVANTAGE
THEY
TEND
TO
MAKE
EMPLOYEES
PASSIONATE
HARD
WORKING
FLEXIBLE
AND
CONCERNED
IN
A
MARKET
WHERE
EMPLOY
EES
LOYALTY
TO
THEIR

IS
OFTEN

ARE
ONE
OF
THE

OPEN

SHOWS
THE
POTENTIAL
OF
SOCIAL

IN
THE
CASE
OF

OTHER
COLLABORATIVE

YOU
CAN
POST
A
PROBLEM
ABOUT
A

ON
ONE
OF
THE

AND
SEE
HOW
FAST
SOMEONE
OR
OFTEN
MANY
PEOPLE
WILL

AND
FIX
THE

USING
THEIR

COULD
YOU

FOR

IF
YOU

HIRE
PEOPLE
OF
THE

THEY
WOULD
COST
YOU
AN
ARM
AND
A

RATHER
PEOPLE
IN
THESE
COMMUNITIES
ARE
HAPPY
TO
GIVE
THEIR

TO
SOCIETY
AT

FOR
WHICH
THEY
GET
THE
SAME
SOCIAL
BENEFITS
WE
ALL
GET
FROM
HELPING
A

PAINT
A

WHAT
CAN
WE
LEARN
FROM
THIS
THAT
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
THERE
ARE
SOCIAL
REWARDS
THAT
STRONGLY
MOTIVATE
BEHAVIOR
AND
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
USED
IN
CORPORATE
LIFE
IS
THE
ENCOURAGEMENT
OF
SOCIAL
REWARDS
AND
REPUTATION
IN
TREATING
THEIR
EMPLOYEES
MUCH
AS
IN
TREATING
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
COMPANIES
MUST
UNDERSTAND
THEIR
IMPLIED
LONG
TERM
COMMITMENT
IF
EMPLOYEES
PROMISE
TO
WORK
HARDER
TO
ACHIEVE
AN
IMPORTANT
DEADLINE
EVEN
CANCELING

OBLIGA
TIONS
FOR
IT
IF
THEY
ARE
ASKED
TO
GET
ON
AN
AIRPLANE
AT
A
MO
MENT
NOTICE
TO
ATTEND
A
MEETING
THEN
THEY
MUST
GET
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
IN
RETURN
SOMETHING
LIKE
SUPPORT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
SICK
OR
A
CHANCE
TO
HOLD
ON
TO
THEIR
JOBS
WHEN
THE
MARKET
THREATENS
TO
TAKE
THEIR
JOBS
AWAY
ALTHOUGH
SOME
COMPANIES
HAVE
BEEN
SUCCESSFUL
IN
CREAT
ING
SOCIAL
NORMS
WITH
THEIR
WORKERS
THE
CURRENT
OBSESSION
WITH
SHORT
TERM
PROFITS
OUTSOURCING
AND
DRACONIAN

TING
THREATENS
TO
UNDERMINE
IT
ALL
IN
A

AFTER
ALL
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
SOMETHING
GOES
AWRY
THE
OTHER
PARTY
WILL
BE
THERE
FOR
THEM
TO
PROTECT
AND
HELP
THEM
THESE
BE
LIEFS
ARE
NOT
SPELLED
OUT
IN
A

BUT
THEY
ARE
GENERAL
OBLIGATIONS
TO
PROVIDE
CARE
AND
HELP
IN
TIMES
OF
NEED
AGAIN
COMPANIES
CANNOT
HAVE
IT
BOTH
WAYS
IN

I
AM
WORRIED
THAT
THE
RECENT
CUTS
WE
SEE
IN
EMPLOYEES
BENEFITS
CHILD
CARE
PENSIONS
FLEXTIME
EXERCISE
ROOMS
THE
CAFETERIA
FAMILY

ETC
ARE
LIKELY
TO
COME
AT
THE
EX

OF
THE

AND
THUS
AFFECT
WORKERS
PRO
DUCTIVITY
I
AM
PARTICULARLY
WORRIED
THAT
CUTS
AND
CHANGES
IN
MEDICAL
BENEFITS
ARE
LIKELY
TO
TRANSFORM
MUCH
OF
THE
EMPLOYER
EMPLOYEE
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIP
TO
A
MARKET
RELATIONSHIP
IF
COMPANIES
WANT
TO
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
THEY
NEED
TO
DO
A
BETTER
JOB
OF
CULTIVATING
THOSE
NORMS
MEDICAL
BENEFITS
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
COMPREHENSIVE
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
ARE
AMONG
THE
BEST
WAYS
A
COMPANY
CAN
EXPRESS
ITS
SIDE
OF
THE
SOCIAL
EXCHANGE
BUT
WHAT
ARE
MANY
COMPANIES
DOING
THEY
ARE
DEMANDING
HIGH
DEDUCTIBLES
IN
THEIR
INSUR
ANCE
PLANS
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
ARE
REDUCING
THE
SCOPE
OF
BENEFITS
SIMPLY
PUT
THEY
ARE
UNDERMINING
THE
SOCIAL
CON
TRACT
BETWEEN
THE
COMPANY
AND
THE
EMPLOYEES
AND
REPLACING
IT
WITH
MARKET
NORMS
AS
COMPANIES
TILT
THE
BOARD
AND
EM
PLOYEES
SLIDE
FROM
SOCIAL
NORMS
TO
THE
REALM
OF
MARKET
NORMS
CAN
WE
BLAME
THEM
FOR
JUMPING
SHIP
WHEN
A
BETTER
OFFER
AP
PEARS
IT
REALLY
NO
SURPRISE
THAT
CORPORATE
LOYALTY
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
LOYALTY
OF
EMPLOYEES
TO
THEIR
COMPANIES
HAS
BECOME
AN
OXYMORON
ORGANIZATIONS
CAN
ALSO
THINK
CONSCIOUSLY
ABOUT
HOW
PEO
PLE
REACT
TO
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
SHOULD
YOU
GIVE
AN
EMPLOYEE
A
GIFT
WORTH
OR
PAY
HIM
OR
HER
AN
EXTRA
IN
CASH
WHICH
IS
BETTER
IF
YOU
ASK
THE
EMPLOYEES
THE
MAJORITY
WILL
MOST
LIKELY
PREFER
CASH
OVER
THE
GIFT
BUT
THE
GIFT
HAS
ITS
VALUE
THOUGH
THIS
IS
SOMETIMES
ILL
UNDERSTOOD
IT
CAN
PROVIDE
A
BOOST
TO
THE
SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE

AND
THE

AND
BY
DOING
SO
PROVIDE
LONG

TO
EVERYONE
THINK
OF
IT
THIS
WAY
WHO
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
IS
LIKELY
TO

HARDER
SHOW
MORE
LOYALTY
AND
TRULY
LOVE
HIS

MORE
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
GETTING
IN
CASH
OR
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
GETTING
A
PERSONAL
GIFT
OF
COURSE
A
GIFT
IS
A
SYMBOLIC
GESTURE
AND
TO
BE
SURE
NO
ONE
IS
GOING
TO
WORK
FOR
GIFTS
RATHER
THAN
A
SALARY
FOR
THAT
MATTER
NO
ONE
IS
GOING
TO
WORK
FOR
NOTHING
BUT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
COMPANIES
LIKE
GOOGLE
WHICH
OFFERS
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
BEN
EFITS
FOR
EMPLOYEES
INCLUDING
FREE
GOURMET
LUNCHES
YOU
CAN
SEE
HOW
MUCH
GOODWILL
IS
CREATED
BY
EMPHASIZING
THE
SOCIAL
SIDE
OF
THE
COMPANY
WORKER
RELATIONSHIP
IT
REMARKABLE
HOW
MUCH
WORK
COMPANIES
PARTICULARLY
START
UPS
CAN
GET
OUT
OF
PEOPLE
WHEN
SOCIAL
NORMS
SUCH
AS
THE
EXCITEMENT
OF
BUILDING
SOMETHING
TOGETHER
ARE
STRONGER
THAN
MARKET
NORMS
SUCH
AS
SALARIES
STEPPING
UP
WITH
EACH
PROMOTION
IF
CORPORATIONS
STARTED
THINKING
IN
TERMS
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
THEY
WOULD
REALIZE
THAT
THESE
NORMS
BUILD
LOYALTY
AND
MORE
IMPORTANT
MAKE
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
EXTEND
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
CORPORATIONS
NEED
TODAY
TO
BE
FLEXIBLE
CON
CERNED
AND
WILLING
TO
PITCH
IN
THAT
WHAT
A
SOCIAL
RELATION
SHIP
DELIVERS
TMS
QUESTION
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
IN
THE
WORKPLACE
IS
ONE
WE
SHOULD
BE
THINKING
ABOUT
FREQUENTLY
AMERICA
PRODUCTIVITY
DEPENDS
INCREASINGLY
ON
THE
TALENT
AND
EFFORTS
OF
ITS
WORKERS
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
WE
ARE
DRIVING
BUSINESS
FROM
THE
REALM
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
INTO

NORMS
ARE
WORKERS
THINKING
IN
TERMS
OF
MONEY
RATHER
THAN
THE
SOCIAL
VALUES
OF
LOYALTY
AND
TRUST
WHAT
WILL
THAT
DO
TO
AMERICAN
PRODUCTIVITY
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
IN
TERMS
OF
CREATIVITY
AND
COMMITMENT
AND
WHAT
OF
THE
SOCIAL
CONTRACT
BETWEEN

AND
THE
CITIZEN
IS
THAT
AT
RISK
AS
WELL
AT
SOME
LEVEL
WE
ALL
KNOW
THE
ANSWERS
WE
UNDERSTAND
FOR
INSTANCE
THAT
A
SALARY
ALONE
WILL
NOT
MOTIVATE
PEOPLE
TO
RISK
THEIR
LIVES
POLICE
OFFICERS
FIREFIGHTERS
SOLDIERS
THEY
DON
T
DIE
FOR
THEIR
WEEKLY
PAY
IT
THE
SOCIAL
NORMS
PRIDE
IN
THEIR
PROFESSION
AND
A
SENSE
OF
DUTY
THAT
WILL
MOTIVATE
THEM
TO
GIVE
UP
THEIR
LIVES
AND
HEALTH
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IN
MIAMI
ONCE
ACCOMPANIED
A
U
CUSTOMS
AGENT
ON
A
PATROL
OF
THE
OFFSHORE
WATERS
THE
AGENT
CARRIED
AN
ASSAULT
RIFLE
AND
COULD
CERTAINLY
HAVE
POUNDED
SEVERAL
HOLES
INTO
A
FLEEING
DRUG
BOAT
BUT
HAD
HE
EVER
DONE
SO
NO
WAY
HE
REPLIED
HE
WASN
T
ABOUT
TO
GET
HIMSELF
KILLED
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
SALARY
HE
RECEIVED
IN
FACT
HE
CONFIDED
HIS
GROUP
HAD
AN
UNSPOKEN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
DRUG
COURIERS
THE
FEDS
WOULDN
T
FIRE
IF
THE
DRUG
DEALERS
DIDN
T
FIRE
PERHAPS
THAT
WHY
WE
RARELY
IF
EVER
HEAR
ABOUT
GUN
BATTLES
ON
THE
EDGES
OF
AMERICA
WAR
ON
DRUGS
HOW
COULD
WE
CHANGE
THIS
SITUATION
FIRST
WE
COULD
MAKE
THE
FEDERAL
SALARY
SO
GOOD
THAT
THE
CUSTOMS
AGENT
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
RISK
HIS
LIFE
FOR
IT
BUT
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
IS
THAT
COMPENSATION
EQUAL
TO
WHAT
THE
TYPICAL
DRUG
TRAFFICKER
GETS
FOR
RACING
A
BOAT
FROM
THE
BAHAMAS
TO
MIAMI
ALTERNATIVELY
WE
COULD
ELEVATE
THE
SOCIAL
NORM
MAKING
THE
OFFICER
FEEL
THAT
HIS
MISSION
IS
WORTH
MORE
THAN
HIS
BASE
PAY
THAT
WE
HONOR
HIM
AS
WE
HONOR
OUR
POLICE
AND
FIREFIGHTERS
FOR
A
JOB
WHICH
NOT
ONLY
STABILIZES
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
SOCIETY
BUT
ALSO
SAVES
OUR
KIDS
FROM
ALL
KINDS
OF
DANGERS
THAT
WOULD
TAKE
SOME
INSPI
RATIONAL
LEADERSHIP
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
COULD
BE
DONE
LET
ME
DESCRIBE
HOW
THAT
SAME
THOUGHT
APPLIES
TO
THE
WORLD
OF
EDUCATION
I
RECENTLY
JOINED
A
FEDERAL
COMMITTEE
ON
INCENTIVES
AND
ACCOUNTABILITY
IN
PUBLIC
EDUCATION
THIS
IS
ONE
ASPECT
OF
SOCIAL
AND
MARKET
NORMS
THAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
EX
PLORE
IN
THE
YEARS
TO
COME
OUR
TASK
IS
TO
REEXAMINE
THE
NO
CHILD
LEFT
BEHIND
POLICY
AND
TO
HELP
FIND
WAYS
TO
MOTIVATE
STUDENTS
TEACHERS
ADMINISTRATORS
AND
PARENTS
MY
FEELING
SO
FAR
IS
THAT
STANDARDIZED
TESTING
AND
PERFORMANCE
BASED
SALARIES
ARE
LIKELY
TO
PUSH
EDUCATION
FROM
SOCIAL
NORMS
TO
MARKET
NORMS
THE
UNITED
STATES
ALREADY
SPENDS
MORE
MONEY
PER
STUDENT
THAN
ANY
OTHER
WESTERN
SOCI
ETY
WOULD
IT
BE
WISE
TO
ADD
MORE
MONEY
THE
SAME
CON
SIDERATION
APPLIES
TO
TESTING
WE
ARE
ALREADY
TESTING
VERY
FREQUENTLY
AND
MORE
TESTING
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
IMPROVE
THE
QUAL
ITY
OF
EDUCATION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
ONE
ANSWER
LIES
IN
THE
REALM
OF
SOCIAL
NORMS
AS
WE
LEARNED
IN
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
CASH
WILL
TAKE
YOU
ONLY
SO
FAR
SOCIAL
NORMS
ARE
THE
FORCES
THAT
CAN
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
INSTEAD
OF
FOCUSING
THE
ATTENTION
OF
THE
TEACH
ERS
PARENTS
AND
KIDS
ON
TEST
SCORES
SALARIES
AND
COMPETI
TION
IT
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
TO
INSTILL
IN
ALL
OF
US
A
SENSE
OF
PURPOSE
MISSION
AND
PRIDE
IN
EDUCATION
TO
DO
THIS
WE
CERTAINLY
CAN
T
TAKE
THE
PATH
OF
MARKET
NORMS
THE
BEATLES
PROCLAIMED
SOME
TIME
AGO
THAT
YOU
CAN
T
BUY
ME
LOVE
AND
THIS
ALSO
APPLIES
TO
THE
LOVE
OF
LEARNING
YOU
CAN
T
BUY
IT
AND
IF
YOU
TRY
YOU
MIGHT
CHASE
IT
AWAY
SO
HOW
CAN
WE
IMPROVE
THE
EDUCATIONAL
SYSTEM
WE
SHOULD
PROBABLY
FIRST
RETHINK
SCHOOL
CURRICULA
AND
LINK
THEM
IN
MORE
OBVIOUS
WAYS
TO
SOCIAL
GOALS
ELIMINATION
OF
POVERTY
AND
CRIME
ELEVATION
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
ETC
TECHNOLOGICAL
GOALS
BOOSTING
ENERGY
CONSERVATION
SPACE
EXPLORATION
NANOTECH
NOLOGY
ETC
AND
MEDICAL
GOALS
CURES
FOR
CANCER
DIABETES
OBESITY
ETC
THAT
WE
CARE
ABOUT
AS
A
SOCIETY
THIS
WAY
THE
STUDENTS
TEACHERS
AND
PARENTS
MIGHT
SEE
THE
LARGER
POINT
IN
EDUCATION
AND
BECOME
MORE
ENTHUSIASTIC
AND
MOTIVATED
ABOUT
IT
WE
SHOULD
ALSO
WORK
HARD
ON
MAKING
EDUCATION
A
GOAL
IN
ITSELF
AND
STOP
CONFUSING
THE
NUMBER
OF
HOURS
STUDENTS
SPEND
IN
SCHOOL
WITH
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
EDUCATION
THEY
GET
KIDS
CAN
GET
EXCITED
ABOUT
MANY
THINGS
BASEBALL
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
IT
IS
OUR
CHALLENGE
AS
A
SOCIETY
TO
MAKE
THEM
WANT
TO
KNOW
AS
MUCH
ABOUT
NOBEL
LAUREATES
AS
THEY
NOW
KNOW
ABOUT
BASE
BALL
PLAYERS
I
AM
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
IGNITING
A
SOCIAL
PASSION
FOR
EDUCATION
IS
SIMPLE
BUT
IF
WE
SUCCEED
IN
DOING
SO
THE
VALUE
COULD
BE
IMMENSE
MONEY
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
IS
VERY
OFTEN
THE
MOST
EXPENSIVE
WAY
TO
MOTIVATE
PEOPLE
SOCIAL
NORMS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
CHEAPER
BUT
OFTEN
MORE
EFFECTIVE
AS
WELL
SO
WHAT
GOOD
IS
MONEY
IN
ANCIENT
TIMES
MONEY
MADE
TRADING
EASIER
YOU
DIDN
T
HAVE
TO
SLING
A
GOOSE
OVER
YOUR
BACK
WHEN
YOU
WENT
TO
MARKET
OR
DECIDE
WHAT
SECTION
OF
THE
GOOSE
WAS
EQUIVALENT
TO
A
HEAD
OF
LETTUCE
IN
MODERN
TIMES
MONEY
HAS
EVEN
MORE
BENEFITS
AS
IT
ALLOWS
US
TO
SPECIALIZE
BORROW
AND
SAVE
BUT
MONEY
HAS
ALSO
TAKEN
ON
A
LIFE
OF
ITS
OWN
AS
WE
HAVE
SEEN
IT
CAN
REMOVE
THE
BEST
IN
HUMAN
INTERACTIONS
SO
DO
WE
NEED
MONEY
OF
COURSE
WE
DO
BUT
COULD
THERE
BE
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
OUR
LIFE
THAT
WOULD
BE
IN
SOME
WAYS
BETTER
WITHOUT
IT
THAT
A
RADICAL
IDEA
AND
NOT
AN
EASY
ONE
TO
IMAGINE
BUT
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
I
HAD
A
TASTE
OF
IT
AT
THAT
TIME
I
GOT
A
PHONE
CALL
FROM
JOHN
PERRY
BARLOW
A
FORMER
LYRICIST
FOR
THE
GRATE
FUL
DEAD
INVITING
ME
TO
AN
EVENT
THAT
PROVED
TO
BE
BOTH
AN
IMPORTANT
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
AND
AN
INTERESTING
EXERCISE
IN
CREATING
A
MONEYLESS
SOCIETY
BARLOW
TOLD
ME
THAT
I
HAD
TO
COME
TO
BURNING
MAN
WITH
HIM
AND
THAT
IF
I
DID
I
WOULD
FEEL
AS
IF
I
HAD
COME
HOME
BURNING
MAN
IS
AN
ANNUAL
WEEK
LONG
EVENT
OF
SELF
EXPRESSION
AND
SELF
RELIANCE
HELD
IN
BLACK
ROCK
DESERT
NEVADA
REGULARLY
ATTENDED
BY
MORE
THAN
PEOPLE
BURNING
MAN
STARTED
IN
ON

IN
SAN

WHEN
A
SMALL

DESIGNED
BUILT
AND
EVENTUALLY
SET
FIRE
TO
AN
EIGHT
FOOT
WOODEN
STATUE
OF
A
MAN
AND
A
SMALLER
WOODEN
DOG
SINCE
THEN
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
MAN
BE
ING
BURNED
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ATTEND
THE
FESTIVI
TIES
HAS
GROWN
CONSIDERABLY
AND
THE
EVENT
IS
NOW
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
ART
FESTIVALS
AND
AN
ONGOING
EXPERIMENT
IN
TEMPORARY
COMMUNITY
BURNING
MAN
HAS
MANY
EXTRAORDINARY
ASPECTS
BUT
FOR
ME
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
REMARKABLE
IS
ITS
REJECTION
OF
MARKET
NORMS
MONEY
IS
NOT
ACCEPTED
AT
BURNING
MAN
RATHER
THE
WHOLE
PLACE
WORKS
AS
A
GIFT
EXCHANGE
ECONOMY
YOU
GIVE
THINGS
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THEY
WILL
GIVE
SOMETHING
BACK
TO
YOU
OR
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE
AT

ENJOYED
TRYING
TO
SOLVE
THEM
AT
FIRST
THIS
WAS
ALL
VERY
STRANGE
BUT
BEFORE
LONG
I
FOUND
MYSELF
ADOPTING
THE
NORMS
OF
BURNING
MAN
I
WAS
SURPRISED
IN
FACT
TO
FIND
THAT
BURNING
MAN
WAS
THE
MOST
ACCEPTING
SOCIAL
AND
CARING
PLACE
I
HAD
EVER
BEEN
I
M
NOT
SURE
I
COULD
EASILY
SURVIVE
IN
BURNING
MAN
FOR
ALL
WEEKS
OF
THE
YEAR
BUT
THIS
EXPERIENCE
HAS
CONVINCED
ME
THAT
LIFE
WITH
FEWER
MARKET
NORMS
AND
MORE
SOCIAL
NORMS
WOULD
BE
MORE
SATISFY
ING
CREATIVE
FULFILLING
AND
FUN
THEANSWER
I
BELIEVE
IS
NOT
TO
RE
CREATE
SOCIETY
AS
BURN
ING
MAN
BUT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
SOCIAL
NORMS
CAN
PLAY
A
FAR
GREATER
ROLE
IN
SOCIETY
THAN
WE
HAVE
BEEN
GIVING
THEM
CREDIT
FOR
IF
WE
CONTEMPLATE
HOW
MARKET
NORMS
HAVE
GRADUALLY
TAKEN
OVER
OUR
LIVES
IN
THE
PAST
FEW
DECADES
WITH
THEIR
EM
PHASIS
ON
HIGHER
SALARIES
MORE
INCOME
AND
MORE
SPENDING
WE
MAY
RECOGNIZE
THAT
A
RETURN
TO
SOME
OF
THE
OLD
SOCIAL
NORMS
MIGHT
NOT
BE
SO
BAD
AFTER
ALL
IN
FACT
IT
MIGHT
BRING
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
THE
OLD
CIVILITY
BACK
TO
OUR
LIVES
CHEERLEADERS
AND
VICARIOUS
FANS
THE
PRIUS
HYBRID
IS
A
NEW
CAR
BASED
ON
A
HUNDRED
YEAR
OLD
TECHNOLOGY
THAT
NO
DOMESTIC
CARMAKER
CARED
ENOUGH
ABOUT
TO
DEVELOP
TODAY
THERE
A
LONG
LIST
OF
BRANDS
FOLLOWING
TOYOTA
THE
TRIBE
HAS
TURNED
INTO
A
MOVEMENT
THIS
IS
ASTOUNDING
THE
BIGGEST
STAIDEST
CONSUMER
PRODUCT
INDUSTRY
TURNING
ITSELF
UPSIDE
DOWN
IN
JUST
A
FEW
YEARS
IF
STRUGGLING

OVERHEAD

CAN

ACCEPTANCE
IMAGINE
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
WITH
THIS
NEW
LEVERAGE
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
FOR
A
LIVING
WHAT
DO
YOU
MAKE
LEADERS
MAKE
A
RUCKUS
LEADING
FROM
THE
BOTTOM
THE
SKEPTICAL
AMONG
US
LOOK
AT
THE
IDEA
OF
LEADERSHIP
AND
WE
HESITATE
WE
HESITATE
BECAUSE
IT
FEELS
LIKE
SOMETHING
WE
NEED
TO
BE
ORDAINED
TO
DO
THAT
WITHOUT
AUTHORITY
WE
CAN
T
LEAD
THAT
BIG
ORGANIZATIONS
RESERVE
LEADERSHIP
FOR
THE
CEO
NOT
FOR
US
PERHAPS
YOU
WORK
AT
A
BIG
ORGANIZATION
PERHAPS
YOU
FEEL
AS
THOUGH
THERE
JUST
TOO
MUCH
RESISTANCE
TO
CHANGE
HERE
A
QUESTION
IS
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
STIFFER
THAN
THE
PENTAGON
MORE
BUREAUCRATIC
OR
FORMALIZED
THOMAS
BARNETT
CHANGED
THE
PENTAGON
FROM
THE
BOTTOM
NO
HE
WASN
T
ON
KP
DUTY
BUT
HE
WAS
CLOSE
HE
HAD
NO
STATUS
NO
RANK
HE
WAS
JUST
A
RESEARCHER
WITH
A
BIG
IDEA
HERE
WHAT
THE
WALL
STREET
JOURNAL
SAID
MR
BARNETT
OVERHAULED
THE
CONCEPT
TO
ADDRESS
MORE
DIRECTLY
THE
POST
WORLD
THE
RESULT
IS
A
THREE
HOUR
POWERPOINT
PRESENTATION
THAT
MORE
RESEMBLES
PERFORMANCE
ART
THAN
A
PENTAGON
BRIEFING
IT
MAKING
MR
BARNETT
YEARS
OLD
A
KEY
FIGURE
IN
THE
DEBATE
CURRENTLY
RAGING
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
MODERN
MILITARY
SHOULD
LOOK
LIKE
SENIOR
MILITARY
OFFICIALS
SAY
HIS
DECIDEDLY
CONTROVERSIAL
IDEAS
ARE
INFLUENCING
THE
WAY
THE
PENTAGON
VIEWS
ITS
ENEMIES
VULNERABILITIES
AND
FUTURE
STRUCTURE
IT
SIMPLE
REALLY
BARNETT
LED
A
TRIBE
THAT
WAS
PASSIONATE
ABOUT
CHANGE
HE
GALVANIZED
THEM
INSPIRED
THEM
AND
CONNECTED
THEM
THROUGH
HIS
IDEA
ONE
MAN
WITH
NO
AUTHORITY
SUDDENLY
BECOMES
A
KEY
FIGURE
TRIBES
GIVE
EACH
OF
US
THE
VERY
SAME
OPPORTUNITY
SKILL
AND
ATTITUDE
ARE
ESSENTIAL
AUTHORITY
IS
NOT
IN
FACT
AUTHORITY
CAN
GET
IN
THE
WAY
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
AND
JACK
IT
WORTH
TAKING
A
SECOND
TO
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
IT
REALLY
MEANS
TO
BE
A
TRIBE
IN
PERMISSION
MARKETING
YEARS
AGO
I
WROTE
ABOUT
HOW
MARKETERS
MUST
EARN
THE
RIGHT
TO
DELIVER
ANTICIPATED
PERSONAL
AND
RELEVANT
MESSAGES
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
TO
GET
THEM
AND
THAT
STILL
CORRECT
AS
FAR
AS
IT
GOES
BUT
TRIBES
GO
MUCH
FURTHER
THAT
BECAUSE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
MESSAGES
THAT
GO
FROM
THE
MARKETER
OR
THE
LEADER
TO
THE
TRIBE
THERE
ARE
THE
MESSAGES
THAT
GO
SIDEWAYS
FROM
MEMBER
TO
MEMBER
AND
BACK
TO
THE
LEADER
AS
WELL
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
UNDERSTOOD
THIS
THEY
CREATED
CONCERTS
TO
ALLOW
PEOPLE
NOT
JUST
TO
HEAR
THEIR
MUSIC
BUT
TO
HEAR
IT
TOGETHER
THAT
WHERE
THE
TRIBE
PART
COMES
IN
I
JUST
HEARD
ABOUT
JACK
AN
OCCASIONAL
RESTAURANT
RUN
BY
DANIELLE
SUCHER
AND
DAVE
TURNER
IN
BROOKLYN
THEY
OPEN
THE
RESTAURANT
ONLY
ABOUT
TWENTY
TIMES
A
YEAR
ON
SATURDAY
NIGHTS
BY
APPOINTMENT
GO
ONLINE
AND
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
MENU
IN
ADVANCE
THEN
YOU
BOOK
AND
PAY
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GO
INSTEAD
OF
SEEKING
DINERS
FOR
THEIR
DISHES
DANIELLE
AND
DAVE
GET
TO
CREATE
DISHES
FOR
THEIR
DINERS
INSTEAD
OF
SERVING
ANONYMOUS
PATRONS
THEY
THROW
A
PARTY
DANIELLE
IS
THE
FOOD
COLUMNIST
FOR
THE
POPULAR
GOTHAMIST
WEB
SITE
AND
SHE
AND
DAVE
RUN
THE
FOOD
BLOG
HABEAS
BRÛLÉE
THAT
MEANS
THEY
ALREADY
INTERACT
WITH
THE
TRIBE
IT
MEANS
THAT
ONCE
THE
RESTAURANT
IS
UP
AND
RUNNING
IT
BECOMES
THE
CENTRAL
CLEARINGHOUSE
THE
PLACE
TO
HANG
OUT
WITH
THE
OTHER
TRIBE
MEMBERS
IF
THE
FOOD
IS
DARING
AND
THE
SERVICE
IS
GENEROUS
JACK
CAN
T
FAIL
THE
MARKET
REQUIRES
CHANGE
AND
THAT
REQUIRES
LEADERSHIP
IF
LEADERSHIP
IS
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
CHANGE
YOUR
TRIBE
BELIEVES
IN
AND
THE
MARKET
DEMANDS
CHANGE
THEN
THE
MARKET
DEMANDS
LEADERS
MANAGERS
MANAGE
BY
USING
THE
AUTHORITY
THE
FACTORY
GIVES
THEM
YOU
LISTEN
TO
YOUR
MANAGER
OR
YOU
LOSE
YOUR
JOB
A
MANAGER
CAN
T
MAKE
CHANGE
BECAUSE
THAT
NOT
HIS
JOB
HIS
JOB
IS
TO
COMPLETE
TASKS
ASSIGNED
TO
HIM
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
IN
THE
FACTORY
LEADERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
DON
T
CARE
VERY
MUCH
FOR
ORGANIZATIONAL
STRUCTURE
OR
THE
OFFICIAL
BLESSING
OF
WHATEVER
FACTORY
THEY
WORK
FOR
THEY
USE
PASSION
AND
IDEAS
TO
LEAD
PEOPLE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
USING
THREATS
AND
BUREAUCRACY
TO
MANAGE
THEM
LEADERS
MUST
BECOME
AWARE
OF
HOW
THE
ORGANIZATION
WORKS
BECAUSE
THIS
AWARENESS
ALLOWS
THEM
TO
CHANGE
IT
LEADERSHIP
DOESN
T
ALWAYS
START
AT
THE
TOP
BUT
IT
ALWAYS
MANAGES
TO
AFFECT
THE
FOLKS
AT
THE
TOP
IN
FACT
MOST
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
WAITING
FOR
SOMEONE
LIKE
YOU
TO
LEAD
THEM
WHAT
DOES
IT
TAKE
TO
CREATE
A
MOVEMENT
IF
WE
LOOK
AT
TWO
NOBEL
PRIZE
WINNERS
AND
THEIR
MOVEMENTS
MUHAMMAD
YUNUS
AND
AL
GORE
SOME
PARALLELS
BECOME
CLEAR
AND
THEY
DIRECTLY
RELATE
TO
THE
TACTICS
AVAILABLE
TO
YOU
AS
YOU
LEAD
YOUR
TRIBE
MICROFINANCE
AS
A
TOOL
TO
FIGHT
POVERTY
AND
THE
EFFORT
TO
RECOGNIZE
AND
STEM
GLOBAL
WARMING
HAVE
BOTH
BECOME
MOVEMENTS
BUT
AS
YASMINA
ZAIDMAN
AT
THE
ACUMEN
FUND
TOLD
ME
BOTH
PROBLEMS
AND
THEIR
SOLUTIONS
WERE
RECOGNIZED
MORE
THAN
THIRTY
YEARS
AGO
WE
WEREN
T
LACKING
THE
ANSWER
MUHAMMAD
YUNUS
HAD
IT
ALL
ALONG
SO
WHY
DID
IT
TAKE
THIRTY
YEARS
FOR
THE
IDEA
TO
GAIN
STEAM
THE
ANSWER
AS
YOU
VE
PROBABLY
GUESSED
IS
THAT
THERE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
TELLING
PEOPLE
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
INCITING
A
MOVEMENT
THE
MOVEMENT
HAPPENS
WHEN
PEOPLE
TALK
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
WHEN
IDEAS
SPREAD
WITHIN
THE
COMMUNITY
AND
MOST
OF
ALL
WHEN
PEER
SUPPORT
LEADS
PEOPLE
TO
DO
WHAT
THEY
ALWAYS
KNEW
WAS
THE
RIGHT
THING
GREAT
LEADERS
CREATE
MOVEMENTS
BY
EMPOWERING
THE
TRIBE
TO
COMMUNICATE
THEY
ESTABLISH
THE
FOUNDATION
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
MAKE
CONNECTIONS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
COMMANDING
PEOPLE
TO
FOLLOW
THEM
THIS
IS
HOW
SKYPE
SPREAD
AROUND
THE
WORLD
COFOUNDER
NIKLAS
ZENNSTRÖM
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
OVERTHROWING
THE
TYRANNY
OF
THE
PHONE
COMPANIES
WAS
TOO
BIG
A
PROJECT
FOR
A
SMALL
COMPANY
BUT
IF
HE
COULD
EMPOWER
THE
TRIBE
TO
DO
IT
THEMSELVES
TO
CONNECT
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
TO
SPREAD
THE
WORD
HE
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
INCITE
A
MOVEMENT
MALCOLM
GLADWELL
WROTE
ABOUT
THE
FALL
OF
THE
BERLIN
WALL
AND
IT
INVOLVED
MUCH
THE
SAME
DYNAMIC
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
EAST
GERMANY
WASN
T
THE
WORK
OF
ONE
HARDWORKING
ACTIVIST
INSTEAD
IT
WAS
THE
GRADUAL
BUT
INEXORABLE
GROWTH
OF
THE
TRIBE
A
LOOSELY
COORDINATED
MOVEMENT
OF
ACTIVISTS
THAT
GAINED
IN
FORCE
UNTIL
IT
COULDN
T
BE
STOPPED
ONE
AFTER
ANOTHER
INTRACTABLE
PROBLEMS
FALL
IN
THE
FACE
OF
MOVEMENTS
IMPROVING
A
TRIBE
AS
WE
SAW
EARLIER
IT
TAKES
ONLY
TWO
THINGS
TO
TURN
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
INTO
A
TRIBE
A
SHARED
INTEREST
A
WAY
TO
COMMUNICATE
THE
COMMUNICATION
CAN
BE
ONE
OF
FOUR
KINDS
LEADER
TO
TRIBE
TRIBE
TO
LEADER
TRIBE
MEMBER
TO
TRIBE
MEMBER
TRIBE
MEMBER
TO
OUTSIDER
SO
A
LEADER
CAN
HELP
INCREASE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THE
TRIBE
AND
ITS
MEMBERS
BY
TRANSFORMING
THE
SHARED
INTEREST
INTO
A
PASSIONATE
GOAL
AND
DESIRE
FOR
CHANGE
PROVIDING
TOOLS
TO
ALLOW
MEMBERS
TO
TIGHTEN
THEIR
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
LEVERAGING
THE
TRIBE
TO
ALLOW
IT
TO
GROW
AND
GAIN
NEW
MEMBERS
MOST
LEADERS
FOCUS
ONLY
ON
THE
THIRD
TACTIC
A
BIGGER
TRIBE
SOMEHOW
EQUALS
A
BETTER
TRIBE
IN
FACT
THE
FIRST
TWO
TACTICS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
LEAD
TO
MORE
IMPACT
EVERY
ACTION
YOU
TAKE
AS
A
LEADER
CAN
AFFECT
THESE
THREE
ELEMENTS
AND
THE
CHALLENGE
IS
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHICH
ONE
TO
MAXIMIZE
THE
AMERICAN
AUTOMOBILE
ASSOCIATION
HAS
MILLIONS
OF
MEMBERS
BUT
IT
ARGUABLY
HAS
FAR
LESS
IMPACT
ON
THE
WORLD
THAN
DO
THE
TWO
THOUSAND
PEOPLE
WHO
GO
TO
THE
TED
CONFERENCE
EACH
YEAR
ONE
IS
ABOUT
BIG
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
ABOUT
CHANGE
THE
NATIONAL
RIFLE
ASSOCIATION
HAS
A
HUGE
IMPACT
ON
THE
POLITICAL
CULTURE
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
FAR
IN
EXCESS
OF
THE
ORGANIZATION
ACTUAL
SIZE
THAT
BECAUSE
THE
TRIBE
IS
EXTRAORDINARILY
WELL
CONNECTED
COMMUNICATING
UP
DOWN
AND
SIDEWAYS
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
A
PASSIONATE
MISSION
NOT
JUST
A
COMMON
IDEA
THE
NEW
TOOLS
AND
TECHNOLOGIES
AVAILABLE
TO
GROUPS
ARE
TRANSFORMING
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
THINK
OF
TRIBAL
COMMUNICATION
SMART
LEADERS
ARE
GRABBING
THOSE
TOOLS
AND
PUTTING
THEM
TO
WORK
WHAT
TRIBES
LEAVE
BEHIND
BUILD
A
COMPANY
AND
YOU
LL
LEAVE
A
TRACE
A
FACTORY
ADVERTISING
THE
NONRECYCLABLE
JUNK
PRODUCED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
YOUR
EFFORTS
THINKING
ABOUT
STUFF
IS
EASY
BECAUSE
WE
CAN
SEE
AND
TOUCH
AND
HOLD
STUFF
STUFF
SEEMS
TO
MATTER
BECAUSE
IT
HERE

HERE
WHAT
AMAZED
ME

UNLIKE
THE

OF

THE

CONNECTIONS
YOU
CAN
CREATE
WITH

GROW
THEY
DON
T
FADE
AS
THE

MATURES
AND

IT
HAS
ONLY
ABOUT

THAT
JIMMY

WIKIPEDIA
COFOUNDER
BUILT
THE

IS
INSTRUCTIVE
HE
ATTRACTED
A
SMALL
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
ONLY
FIVE
THOUSAND
PEOPLE
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
WORK
ON
THE
ARTICLES
ON
THE

AND
ENGAGED
THEM
IN
A
VISION
HE
DIDN

TELL
THEM
WHAT
TO

HE
DIDN

MANAGE
THE
EFFORT
HE
LED
IT
WALES
CONNECTED
THE
TRIBE
MEMBERS
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
WITH
EVER
EVOLVING
TECHNOLOGY
THAT
MADE
IT
EASIER
AND
EASIER
FOR
THEM
TO
ENGAGE
AND
COMMUNICATE
AND
HE
GAVE
THE
TRIBE
A
PLATFORM
THEY
COULD
USE
TO
ENGAGE
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
THAT
IT
THREE
STEPS
MOTIVATE
CONNECT
AND
LEVERAGE
LEADING
FROM
THE
BOTTOM
WITH
A
NEWSLETTER
IN
AT
THE
AGE
OF
TWENTY
FOUR
I
JOINED
A
TINY
SOFTWARE
COMPANY
CALLED
SPINNAKER
BASED
IN
CAMBRIDGE
MASSACHUSETTS
WE
WERE
CRAZY
ENOUGH
TO
EMBRACE
THE
AUDACIOUS
GOAL
OF
INVENTING
THE
FIRST
GENERATION
OF
EDUCATIONAL
COMPUTER
GAMES
I
WAS
THE
THIRTIETH
EMPLOYEE
AFTER
MY
SUMMER
INTERNSHIP
SPINNAKER
OFFERED
ME
A
JOB
STARTING
A
NEW
BRAND
THEY
WANTED
ME
TO
ACQUIRE
SCIENCE
FICTION
STORIES
AND
TURN
THEM
INTO
LITERARY
ADVENTURE
GAMES
BYRON
PREISS
HAD
ALREADY
SOLD
US
THE
RIGHTS
TO
FAHRENHEIT
AND
A
FEW
OTHER
NOVELS
AND
I
HAD
TO
ACQUIRE
OTHERS
AND
TURN
THEM
ALL
INTO
PRODUCTS
READY
FOR
STORES
NATIONWIDE
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
NO
ONE
WORKED
FOR
ME
NO
SECRETARY
NO
STAFF
NO
PROGRAMMERS
SPINNAKER
WAS
BUSY
BUILDING
DOZENS
OF
PRODUCTS
AND
ABOUT
FORTY
PROGRAMMERS
IN
THE
ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
WERE
ALLOCATED
ON
A
ROTATING
BASIS
TO
VARIOUS
PROJECTS
I
WAS
LENT
PRECISELY
THREE
PROGRAMMERS
I
NEEDED
MORE
A
LOT
MORE
IF
I
WAS
GOING
TO
MAKE
MY
CHRISTMAS
SHIP
DATE
SO
I
STARTED
A
NEWSLETTER
THE
NEWSLETTER
HIGHLIGHTED
THE
WORK
OF
EVERY
PERSON
WHO
WORKED
ON
ONE
OF
MY
PRODUCTS
IT
HIGHLIGHTED
THEIR
BREAKTHROUGHS
AND
TALKED
ABOUT
THE
NEW
GROUND
WE
WERE
BREAKING
MUSIC
IN
A
GAME
I
MADE
PHOTOCOPIES
AND
DISTRIBUTED
THE
NEWSLETTER
TO
THE
INTEROFFICE
MAILBOX
OF
EVERY
PERSON
IN
THE
COMPANY
BY
THEN
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
TWICE
A
WEEK
THE
NEWSLETTER
WENT
OUT
TWICE
A
WEEK
I
TALKED
ABOUT
OUR
QUEST
TWICE
A
WEEK
I
CHRONICLED
THE
AMAZING
WORK
OF
OUR
TINY
TRIBE
THE
NEWSLETTER
CONNECTED
THE
TRIBE
MEMBERS
IT
TURNED
A
DISPARATE
GROUP
OF
CAREER
ENGINEERS
INTO
A
WORKING
COMMUNITY
WITHIN
A
MONTH
SIX
ENGINEERS
HAD
DEFECTED
TO
THE
TRIBE
WORKING
WITH
ME
IN
THEIR
SPARE
TIME
THEN
IT
WAS
TWENTY
SOON
EVERY
PERSON
IN
THE
ENTIRE
DEPARTMENT
WAS
EITHER
ASSIGNED
TO
MY
PROJECT
OR
MOONLIGHTING
ON
IT
WE
SHIPPED
FIVE
PRODUCTS
IN
TIME
FOR
CHRISTMAS
AND
EVERY
ONE
WENT
GOLD
SELLING
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
WORTH
OF
COPIES
AND
SAVING
THE
COMPANY
DID
ENGINEERS
SWITCH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
NEWSLETTER
OF
COURSE
NOT
THEY
SWITCHED
FOR
THE
JOURNEY
THEY
WANTED
TO
BE
PART
OF
SOMETHING
THAT
MATTERED
TWENTY
YEARS
LATER
PEOPLE
ON
THAT
TEAM
STILL
TALK
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
BUILT
AND
I
THE
TWENTY
FOUR
YEAR
OLD
WITH
NO
EXPERIENCE
AND
NO
STAFF
GOT
TO
GO
ON
THE
RIDE
OF
A
LIFETIME
IS
THAT
ALL
I
DID
LAUNCH
A
NEWSLETTER
OF
COURSE
NOT
I
DID
DIFFICULT
THINGS
PUSHED
OBSTACLES
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
LIVED
AND
BREATHED
THE
PROJECT
AND
INJECTED
IT
WITH
A
SOUL
THIRTY
OF
US
SLEPT
IN
THE
OFFICE
EVERY
NIGHT
FOR
A
MONTH
TO
MAKE
THE
SHIP
DATE
TWENTY
NINE
HIGHLY
SKILLED
TECHNICAL
PEOPLE
AND
ME
EVERYONE
HAD
A
JOB
TO
DO
THAT
MONTH
AND
MINE
WAS
TO
HELP
EVERYONE
ELSE
COMMUNICATE
EVERYTHING
I
DID
WAS
FOR
US
NOT
FOR
ME
I
DIDN
T
MANAGE
I
LED
CROWDS
AND
TRIBES
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
A
CROWD
IS
A
TRIBE
WITHOUT
A
LEADER
A
CROWD
IS
A
TRIBE
WITHOUT
COMMUNICATION
MOST
ORGANIZATIONS
SPEND
THEIR
TIME
MARKETING
TO
THE
CROWD
SMART
ORGANIZATIONS
ASSEMBLE
THE
TRIBE
CROWDS
ARE
INTERESTING
AND
THEY
CAN
CREATE
ALL
SORTS
OF
WORTHWHILE
ARTIFACTS
AND
MARKET
EFFECTS
BUT
TRIBES
ARE
LONGER
LASTING
AND
MORE
EFFECTIVE
MARKETING
CHANGES
EVERYTHING
BUT
IT
MOSTLY
CHANGES
THE
MARKET
THE
MARKET
WANTS
YOU
TO
BE
REMARKABLE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
TRIBES
ARE
BORED
WITH
YESTERDAY
AND
DEMAND
TOMORROW
MOST
OF
ALL
THE
MARKET
HAS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
IDEAS
THAT
SPREAD
WIN
AND
THE
IDEAS
THAT
ARE
SPREADING
ARE
THE
REMARKABLE
ONES
FOR
FIFTY
YEARS
ESTABLISHED
BRANDS
WITH
EFFICIENT
FACTORIES
AND
EFFECTIVE
MARKETING
CARRIED
THE
DAY
PEPSI
THE
SALVATION
ARMY
AND
THE
LOCAL
HARDWARE
STORE
WERE
THE
CORNERSTONES
OF
THE
MARKETPLACE
SUDDENLY
THOUGH
THE
OLDEST
BRANDS
ARE
NO
LONGER
THE
FASTEST
GROWING
ONES
SUDDENLY
THE
MOST
EXPERIENCED
BUSINESSPEOPLE
ARE
NO
LONGER
THE
MOST
SUCCESSFUL
ONES
AND
SUDDENLY
THE
SAFEST
JOBS
ARE
NOT
SO
SAFE
ANYMORE
THE
MARKETPLACE
HAS
RAISED
ITS
VOICE
IT
NOW
CLEAR
THAT
WE
WANT
NOVELTY
AND
STYLE
AND
MOST
OF
ALL
STUFF
THAT
GREAT
IF
YOU
WANT
US
TO
FOLLOW
YOU
DON
T
BE
BORING
GOOD
ENOUGH
STOPPED
BEING
GOOD
ENOUGH
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
SO
WHY
NOT
BE
GREAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AVERAGE
AND
MEDIOCRE
MANAGEMENT
OFTEN
WORKS
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
STATUS
QUO
TO
DELIVER
AVERAGE
PRODUCTS
TO
AVERAGE
PEOPLE
IN
A
STABLE
ENVIRONMENT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
THE
RIGHT
STRATEGY
BUILD
RELIABILITY
AND
PREDICTABILITY
CUT
COSTS
AND
MAKE
A
PROFIT
TRADITIONAL
MARKETING
THE
MARKETING
OF
PUSH
UNDERSTANDS
THIS
THE
MOST
STABLE
THING
TO
DO
IS
PUSH
A
STANDARD
PRODUCT
TO
A
STANDARD
AUDIENCE
AND
SUCCEED
WITH
DISCOUNTS
OR
DISTRIBUTION
BUT
FOR
TRIBES
AVERAGE
CAN
MEAN
MEDIOCRE
NOT
WORTH
SEEKING
OUT
BORING
LIFE
TOO
SHORT
TO
FIGHT
THE
FORCES
OF
CHANGE
LIFE
TOO
SHORT
TO
HATE
WHAT
YOU
DO
ALL
DAY
LIFE
WAY
TOO
SHORT
TO
MAKE
MEDIOCRE
STUFF
AND
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
THAT
STANDARD
IS
NOW
VIEWED
AS
MEDIOCRE
IS
THERE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AVERAGE
AND
MEDIOCRE
NOT
SO
MUCH
AVERAGE
STUFF
IS
TAKEN
FOR
GRANTED
NOT
TALKED
ABOUT
AND
CERTAINLY
NOT
SOUGHT
OUT
THE
END
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
MANY
REALLY
GOOD
PEOPLE
SPEND
ALL
DAY
TRYING
TO
DEFEND
WHAT
THEY
DO
TRYING
TO
SELL
WHAT
THEY
VE
ALWAYS
SOLD
AND
TRYING
TO
PREVENT
THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS
FROM
BEING
DEVOURED
BY
THE
FORCES
OF
THE
NEW
IT
MUST
BE
WEARING
THEM
OUT
DEFENDING
MEDIOCRITY
IS
EXHAUSTING
HOW
MANY
FANS
DO
YOU
HAVE
IN
AN
ARTICLE
POSTED
ON
HIS
TECHNIUM
WEB
SITE
KEVIN
KELLY
BRILLIANTLY
DESCRIBED
THE
WORLD
OF
TRUE
FANS
A
TRUE
FAN
HE
ARGUES
IS
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
TRIBE
WHO
CARES
DEEPLY
ABOUT
YOU
AND
YOUR
WORK
THAT
PERSON
WILL
CROSS
THE
STREET
TO
BUY
FROM
YOU
OR
BRING
A
FRIEND
TO
HEAR
YOU
OR
INVEST
A
LITTLE
EXTRA
TO
SUPPORT
YOU
AN
INDIVIDUAL
ARTIST
NEEDS
ONLY
A
THOUSAND
TRUE
FANS
IN
HER
TRIBE
IT
ENOUGH
IT
ENOUGH
BECAUSE
A
THOUSAND
FANS
WILL
BRING
YOU
ENOUGH
ATTENTION
AND
SUPPORT
TO
MAKE
A
GREAT
LIVING
TO
REACH
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
DO
GREAT
WORK
IT
ENOUGH
BECAUSE
A
THOUSAND
FANS
TRUE
FANS
FORM
A
TRIBE
A
TRUE
FAN
BRINGS
THREE
FRIENDS
WITH
HIM
TO
A
JOHN
MAYER
CONCERT
OR
TO
THE
OPENING
OF
A
CHUCK
CLOSE
EXHIBIT
A
TRUE
FAN
PAYS
EXTRA
TO
OWN
THE
FIRST
EDITION
OR
BUYS
THE
HARDCOVER
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
BROWSING
AROUND
ON
THE
WEB
SITE
MOST
IMPORTANT
A
TRUE
FAN
CONNECTS
WITH
OTHER
TRUE
FANS
AND
AMPLIFIES
THE
NOISE
THE
ARTIST
MAKES
A
CORPORATION
OR
A
NONPROFIT
OR
A
CHURCH
MAY
NEED
MORE
THAN
THAT
PERHAPS
A
MILLION
FANS
IF
YOU
RE
STARBUCKS
OR
FIFTEEN
MILLION
IF
YOU
RE
RUNNING
FOR
PRESIDENT
BUT
IT
BEYOND
DOUBT
THAT
THERE
A
NUMBER
YOU
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
IT
IS
AND
IT
PROBABLY
FEWER
PEOPLE
THAN
YOU
IMAGINE
TOO
MANY
ORGANIZATIONS
CARE
ABOUT
NUMBERS
NOT
FANS
THEY
CARE
ABOUT
HITS
OR
TURNSTILE
CLICKS
OR
MEDIA
MENTIONS
WHAT
THEY
RE
MISSING
IS
THE
DEPTH
OF
COMMITMENT
AND
INTERCONNECTION
THAT
TRUE
FANS
DELIVER
INSTEAD
OF
ALWAYS
BEING
ON
THE
HUNT
FOR
ONE
MORE
SET
OF
EYEBALLS
TRUE
LEADERS
HAVE
FIGURED
OUT
THAT
THE
REAL
WIN
IS
IN
TURNING
A
CASUAL
FAN
INTO
A
TRUE
ONE
FANS
TRUE
FANS
ARE
HARD
TO
FIND
AND
PRECIOUS
JUST
A
FEW
CAN
CHANGE
EVERYTHING
WHAT
THEY
DEMAND
THOUGH
IS
GENEROSITY
AND
BRAVERY
TWITTER
AND
TRUST
AND
TRIBES
AND
TRUE
FANS
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
SEE
TWITTER
COM
DON
T
GET
IT
IT
SEEMS
INVASIVE
OR
TIME
CONSUMING
OR
EVEN
DUMB
THE
CONVERTS
THOUGH
UNDERSTAND
THE
TRUE
POWER
OF
TWITTER
TWITTER
IS
DECEPTIVELY
SIMPLE
IT
A
WEB
PROTOCOL
THAT
MAKES
IT
EASY
TO
INSTANT
MESSAGE
PEOPLE
WITH
SHORT
NOTES
LIKE
GOING
TO
THE
GYM
IN
FACT
THE
LIMIT
IS
CHARACTERS
ABOUT
HALF
THE
LENGTH
OF
THIS
PARAGRAPH
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AN
INSTANT
MESSAGE
AND
TWITS
THOUGH
IS
THAT
YOUR
INSTANT
MESSAGE
GOES
TO
ONE
PERSON
AND
A
TWIT
GOES
TO
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
CHOSEN
TO
FOLLOW
YOU
EXAMPLE
LAURA
FITTON
A
YOUNG
MOM
IN
BOSTON
HAS
THOUSANDS
OF
PEOPLE
FOLLOWING
HER
ON
TWITTER
EVERY
TIME
SHE
TYPES
IN
A
SHORT
BLURB
THEY
SEE
IT
OVER
TIME
TWIT
BY
TWIT
LAURA
HAS
BUILT
TRUST
WHICH
HAS
LED
TO
A
SUCCESSFUL
CAREER
AS
A
CONSULTANT
AND
A
WORLDWIDE
SPEAKING
PRACTICE
SHE
MET
FASCINATING
PEOPLE
AND
CHANGED
THE
WAY
HER
TRIBE
SEES
THE
WORLD
SHE
NOW
HAS
TRUE
FANS
PEOPLE
WHO
SEEK
HER
OUT
AND
TALK
ABOUT
HER
LAURA
COULDN
T
HAVE
DONE
THIS
WITH
ONE
SPEECH
OR
ONE
BLOG
POST
BUT
BY
CONSISTENTLY
TOUCHING
A
TRIBE
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
GENEROSITY
AND
INSIGHT
SHE
EARNED
THE
RIGHT
TO
LEAD
PERSONALLY
I
CAN
T
IMAGINE
THE
TECHNOLOGY
MATTERING
MUCH
BLOGS
AND
TWITTER
AND
ALL
MANNER
OF
OTHER
TOOLS
WILL
COME
AND
GO
POSSIBLY
BY
THE
TIME
YOU
READ
THIS
THE
TACTICS
ARE
IRRELEVANT
AND
THE
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
CHANGING
THE
ESSENTIAL
LESSON
IS
THAT
EVERY
DAY
IT
GETS
EASIER
TO
TIGHTEN
THE
RELATIONSHIP
YOU
HAVE
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CHOOSE
TO
FOLLOW
YOU
THE
STATUS
QUO
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
DESTROY
THE
STATUS
QUO
WIN
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
PUSH
THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS
WHO
INSPIRE
OTHER
INDIVIDUALS
TO
CHANGE
THE
RULES
THRIVE
AGAIN
WE
RE
BACK
TO
LEADERSHIP
WHICH
CAN
COME
FROM
ANYONE
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
ORGANIZATION
THE
STATUS
QUO
COULD
BE
THE
TIME
THAT
EVERYONE
KNOWS
IT
TAKES
YOU
TO
SHIP
AN
ORDER
OR
THE
COMMISSION
RATE
THAT
EVERYONE
KNOWS
AN
AGENT
OUGHT
TO
BE
PAID
THE
STATUS
QUO
MIGHT
BE
THE
WAY
EVERYONE
EXPECTS
A
PRODUCT
TO
BE
PACKAGED
OR
THE
PRICING
MODEL
THAT
EVERYONE
ACCEPTS
BECAUSE
IT
BEEN
AROUND
SO
LONG
WHATEVER
THE
STATUS
QUO
IS
CHANGING
IT
GIVES
YOU
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
BE
REMARKABLE
INITIATIVE
HAPPINESS
LOOK
AROUND
YOU
LL
SEE
THAT
THE
MARKETPLACE
EVERY
MARKETPLACE
REWARDS
INNOVATION
THINGS
THAT
ARE
FRESH
STYLISH
REMARKABLE
AND
NEW
THE
FASTEST
GROWING
CHURCHES
ARE
THE
NEWEST
ONES
THE
BEST
SELLING
BOOKS
ARE
ALWAYS
THE
SURPRISE
HITS
THAT
COME
OUT
OF
NOWHERE
THE
TAX
SHELTER
THAT
EVERYONE
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
IS
THE
ONE
BASED
ON
THE
LATEST
RULINGS
PRODUCTS
AND
SERVICES
LIKE
THOSE
REQUIRE
INITIATIVE
TO
PRODUCE
YOU
CAN
T
MANAGE
YOUR
WAY
TO
INITIATIVE
INTERESTING
SIDE
EFFECT
CREATING
PRODUCTS
AND
SERVICES
THAT
ARE
REMARKABLE
IS
FUN
DOING
WORK
THAT
FUN
IS
ENGAGING
SO
NOT
SURPRISINGLY
MAKING
THINGS
THAT
ARE
SUCCESSFUL
IS
A
GREAT
WAY
TO
SPEND
YOUR
TIME
THERE
YOU
GO
INITIATIVE
HAPPINESS
CROWBARS
WITH
A
LONG
ENOUGH
CROWBAR
YOU
CAN
RIP
NAILS
OUT
OF
A
BOARD
WITH
A
LONG
ENOUGH
TEETER
TOTTER
YOU
CAN
LIFT
A
SUMO
WRESTLER
OFF
THE
GROUND
WITH
ENOUGH
LEVERAGE
YOU
CAN
CHANGE
YOUR
COMPANY
YOUR
INDUSTRY
AND
THE
WORLD
THE
LEVERS
JUST
GOT
LONGER
FOR
EVERYONE
THE
WEB
AND
WORD
OF
MOUTH
AND
VIRUSES
AND
OUTSOURCING
AND
THE
LONG
TAIL
AND
THE
OTHER
FACTORS
INVOLVED
IN
SOCIAL
MEDIA
MEAN
THAT
EVERYONE
EVERY
PERSON
ALL
SIX
BILLION
OF
US
HAS
FAR
MORE
POWER
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
THE
KING
AND
THE
STATUS
QUO
ARE
IN
BIG
TROUBLE
WAIT
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
GLOSSED
OVER
THAT
LAST
PARAGRAPH
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
IT
SO
SHORT
BUT
ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE
IT
SO
CHALLENGING
WHAT
I
M
SAYING
IS
THAT
ONE
PERSON
CAN
MAKE
A
VIDEO
THAT
REACHES
FIFTY
MILLION
VIEWERS
WHAT
I
M
SAYING
IS
THAT
ONE
PERSON
CAN
INVENT
A

MODEL
THAT
TURNS
AN
INDUSTRY
UPSIDE
DOWN
WHAT
I
M
SAYING
IS
THAT
ONE
PERSON
OKAY
WHAT
I
REALLY
MEAN
IS
YOU
HAS
EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING
YOU
NEED
TO
BUILD
SOMETHING
FAR
BIGGER
THAN
YOURSELF
THE
PEOPLE
AROUND
YOU
REALIZE
THIS
AND
THEY
ARE

IF
YOU

READY
TO
LEAD
SCOTT
BEALE
PARTY
HERE
A
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
OF
A
TRIBE
ENABLED
BY
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
SCOTT
BEALE
IS
AN
IMPRESARIO
WITH
A
LONG
HISTORY
OF
INNOVATION
AND
LEADERSHIP
HIS
COMPANY
LAUGHING
SQUID
DOES
EVERYTHING
FROM
WEB
HOSTING
TO
T
SHIRTS
FROM
LASER
ENGRAVING
TO
ARTS
LISTINGS
IN
SHORT
HE
LEADS
AN
ECLECTIC
TRIBE
AT
THE
SXSW
CONFERENCE
IN
SCOTT
GOT
TIRED
OF
WAITING
IN
LINE
TO
GET
INTO
THE
GOOGLE
PARTY
SO
HE
WALKED
DOWN
THE
STREET
FOUND
A
DESERTED
BAR
GRABBED
SOME
TABLES
IN
THE
BACK
AND
FIRED
UP
HIS
CELL
PHONE
USING
TWITTER
HE
ANNOUNCED
ALTA
VISTA
PARTY
AT
GINGER
MAN
WITHIN
MINUTES
EIGHT
PEOPLE
SHOWED
UP
SHORTLY
THEREAFTER
FIFTY
THEN
THERE
WAS
A
LINE
OUT
THE
DOOR
NO
IT
NOT
A
POLITICAL
MOVEMENT
SURE
IT
A
TRIBE
THE
ENERGY
AND
CONNECTION
OF
THE
TRIBE
ARE
PALPABLE
MULTIPLY
THIS
EFFECT
BY
A
MILLION
SIMILAR
TRIBES
AND
NOW
YOU
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HAPPENING
TRIBES
ARE
JUST
WAITING
TO
BE
TURNED
INTO
MOVEMENTS
AND
OCCASIONALLY
TO
STOP
TO
HAVE
A
BEER
TOGETHER
IT
IMPORTANT
TO
NOTE
THAT
TWITTER
MERELY
ENABLED
THE
EVENT
IT
DIDN
T
CAUSE
IT
TO
OCCUR
UNLESS
SCOTT
HAD
EARNED
THE
RESPECT
AND
PERMISSION
OF
THE
TRIBE
THAT
FOLLOWS
HIM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ALL
ALONE
AT
THE
BAR
THE
PARTY
DIDN
T
TAKE
FOUR
MINUTES
TO
ORGANIZE
IT
TOOK
FOUR
YEARS
A
BRIEF
HISTORY
OF
THE
FACTORY
PART
THE
BEGINNING
TWO
THINGS
CONSPIRED
TO
BRING
US
THE
FACTORY
THE
FIRST
IS
PRETTY
OBVIOUS
FACTORIES
ARE
EFFICIENT
STARTING
A
FACTORY
AND
FILLING
IT
WITH
FACTORY
WORKERS
IS
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
MAKE
A
PROFIT
BY
FACTORY
I
DON
T
NECESSARILY
MEAN
A
PLACE
WITH
HEAVY
MACHINERY
GREASY
FLOORS
AND
A
DIN
I
MEAN
ANY
ORGANIZATION
THAT
CRANKS
OUT
A
PRODUCT
OR
A
SERVICE
DOES
IT
WITH
MEASURABLE
OUTPUT
AND
TRIES
TO
REDUCE
COSTS
AS
IT
GOES
I
MEAN
ANY
JOB
WHERE
YOUR
BOSS
TELLS
YOU
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
HOW
TO
DO
IT
THE
SECOND
REASON
WE
HAVE
FACTORIES
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
EFFICIENCY
AND
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
HUMAN
NATURE
PART
OF
US
WANTS
STABILITY
WE
WANT
THE
ABSENCE
OF
RESPONSIBILITY
THAT
A
FACTORY
JOB
CAN
GIVE
US
THE
IDEA
OF
I
M
DOING
WHAT
YOU
TOLD
ME
TO
IS
VERY
COMPELLING
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
FORAGING
FOR
FOOD
OR
BEGGING
ON
THE
STREETS
SO
WHEN
FACTORIES
SHOWED
UP
WE
RAN
TO
JOIN
THEM
ON
A
RECENT
TRIP
I
TOOK
TO
INDIA
THIS
MIND
SET
WAS
MADE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
ASK
ALMOST
ANYONE
THERE
WHAT
THE
PERFECT
JOB
WOULD
BE
AND
THE
ANSWER
IS
WORKING
AS
A
GOVERNMENT
BUREAUCRAT
NOT
ONLY
DO
YOU
HAVE
AIR
CONDITIONING
BUT
YOU
AREN
T
EVEN
ASKED
TO
TAKE
INITIATIVE
THE
JOB
IS
STEADY
THE
PAY
IS
GOOD
AND
THERE
ARE
NO
SURPRISES
THE
FACTORY
IS
PART
OF
THE
FABRIC
OF
OUR
LIVES
IT
THERE
BECAUSE
IT
PAYS
AND
IT
THERE
BECAUSE
IT
STEADY
AND
IT
THERE
BECAUSE
WE
WANT
IT
WHAT
YOU
WON
T
FIND
IN
A
FACTORY
IS
A
MOTIVATED
TRIBE
MAKING
A
DIFFERENCE
AND
WHAT
YOU
WON
T
FIND
WAITING
OUTSIDE
THE
FACTORY
IS
A
TRIBE
OF
CUSTOMERS
EXCITED
ABOUT
WHAT
TO
COME
A
BRIEF
HISTORY
OF
THE
FACTORY
PART
II
THE
END
SOMEWHERE
ALONG
THE
WAY
PERHAPS
WHEN
TWENTY
THOUSAND
FORD
WORKERS
LOST
THEIR
JOBS
IN
ONE
DAY
OR
WHEN
IT
BECAME
CLEAR
THAT
SOFT
DRINK
COMPANIES
WERE
LOSING
ALL
THEIR
GROWTH
TO
UPSTARTS
THE
FACTORY
ADVANTAGE
BEGAN
TO
FADE
IT
WASN
T
SO
SAFE
TO
HAVE
A
FACTORY
JOB
AFTER
ALL
AND
IN
AN
AGE
OF
LEVERAGE
IN
AN
AGE
WHERE
SMARTS
AND
STYLE
WERE
BEATING
MACHINES
EVERY
TIME
DOING
WHAT
YOUR
BOSS
SAID
WASN
T
SO
ENTICING
EITHER
IF
YOU
COULD
HAVE
ANY
JOB
IN
THE
WORLD
WHAT
WOULD
IT
BE
DID
YOU
SAY
A
LOW
LEVEL
BUREAUCRAT
WORKING
IN
THE
SOCIAL
SECURITY
OFFICE
IN
YONKERS
NEW
YORK
DID
YOU
SAY
A
MIDLEVEL
SUPERVISOR
AT
A
STRUGGLING
GM
PLANT
IN
OHIO
DID
YOU
SAY
FRY
COOK
AT
MCDONALD
SOMEHOW
I
DOUBT
IT
NOW
IT
SEEMS
THE
AIR
CONDITIONING
AND
THE
ILLUSION
OF
DENIABILITY
AREN
T
WORTH
SO
MUCH
NOW
WHEN
WE
ENVISION
OUR
DREAM
JOBS
WE
RE
IMAGINING
SOMEONE
WHO
REAPS
HUGE
REWARDS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
HER
INSIGHT
OR
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
CONTROL
OVER
WHAT
HE
DOES
ALL
DAY
CREATING
PRODUCTS
OR
SERVICES
THAT
HE
ACTUALLY
PROUD
OF
IT
CERTAINLY
INVOLVES
HAVING
AUTHORITY
OVER
YOUR
TIME
AND
YOUR
EFFORT
AND
HAVING
INPUT
INTO
WHAT
YOU
DO
NONE
OF
WHICH
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
WORKING
IN
A
FACTORY
SO
IS
IT
REALLY
A
FREE
AGENT
NATION
THE
AUTHOR
DAN
PINK
COINED
THE
TERM
FREE
AGENT
NATION
TO
DESCRIBE
A
MOVEMENT
OF
SMART
PEOPLE
LEAVING
ORGANIZATIONS
TO
GO
OUT
ON
THEIR
OWN
THAT
NOT
WHAT
I
M
TALKING
ABOUT
THOUGH
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
IT
THE
FACTORIES
WE
DON
T
NEED
ORGANIZATIONS
GIVE
US
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
COMPLEX
PRODUCTS
THEY
PROVIDE
THE
MUSCLE
AND
CONSISTENCY
NECESSARY
TO
GET
THINGS
TO
MARKET
AND
TO
BACK
THEM
UP
MOST
IMPORTANT
ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE
THE
SCALE
TO
CARE
FOR
LARGE
TRIBES
BUT
ORGANIZATIONS
DON
T
HAVE
TO
BE
FACTORIES
NOT
ANYMORE
FACTORIES
ARE
EASY
TO
OUTSOURCE
FACTORIES
CAN
SLOW
YOU
DOWN
THE
ORGANIZATIONS
OF
THE
FUTURE
ARE
FILLED
WITH
SMART
FAST
FLEXIBLE
PEOPLE
ON
A
MISSION
THE
THING
IS
THAT
REQUIRES
LEADERSHIP
IF
YOU
DON
T
HAVE
A
TIME
TESTED
MANUAL
YOU
CAN
T
MANAGE
YOUR
WAY
THROUGH
THIS
IN
UNSTABLE
TIMES
GROWTH
COMES
FROM
LEADERS
WHO
CREATE
CHANGE
AND
ENGAGE
THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS
INSTEAD
OF
FROM
MANAGERS
WHO
PUSH
THEIR
EMPLOYEES
TO
DO
MORE
FOR
LESS
THE
F
WORD
SO
IF
TRIBES
REWARD
INNOVATION
AND
IF
INITIATORS
ARE
HAPPIER
THEN
WHY
DOESN
T
EVERYONE
DO
IT
BECAUSE
OF
FEAR
I
VE
ENCOUNTERED
THOUSANDS
IT
MIGHT
BE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
PEOPLE
WALKING
AROUND
WITH
GREAT
IDEAS
SOME
OF
THE
IDEAS
REALLY
ARE
GREAT
SOME
ARE
MERELY
PRETTY
GOOD
THERE
DOESN
T
SEEM
TO
BE
A
SHORTAGE
OF
IDEAS
ORDINARY
FOLKS
CAN
DREAM
UP
REMARKABLE
STUFF
FAIRLY
EASILY
WHAT
MISSING
IS
THE
WILL
TO
MAKE
THE
IDEAS
HAPPEN
IN
A
BATTLE
BETWEEN
TWO
IDEAS
THE
BEST
ONE
DOESN
T
NECESSARILY
WIN
NO
THE
IDEA
THAT
WINS
IS
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
MOST
FEARLESS
HERETIC
BEHIND
IT
A
LOT
OF
US
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
A
BUREAU
OF
IDEA
APPROVAL
OR
THE
BIA
IF
YOU
LIKE
ACRONYMS
THE
BIA
SITS
IN
JUDGMENT
OF
IDEAS
AND
BLESSES
THE
BEST
ONES
GO
AHEAD
AND
HONE
YOUR
REMARKABLE
CONCEPT
SUBMIT
IT
TO
THE
BIA
AND
LET
THEM
DO
THE
REST
ALAS
IT
NOT
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
LIKE
THAT
ANY
TIME
SOON
THINKING
YOUR
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
FEAR
FEAR
AN
EMOTION
NO
DOUBT
ABOUT
IT
ONE
OF
THE
STRONGEST
OLDEST
AND
MOST
HARDWIRED
THE
MEDIA
LOVE
TO
GLAMORIZE
THE
RARE
DOWNFALL
OF
THE
HERETIC
WHO
DOESN
T
QUITE
MAKE
IT
WE
RE
ALREADY
PRIMED
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
THE
PERSON
WHO
GOT
INTO
TROUBLE
WHO
LOST
HIS
JOB
HIS
HOUSE
HIS
FAMILY
HIS
HAPPINESS
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
THE
HUBRIS
AND
AUDACITY
TO
CHALLENGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
AND
SINCE
WE
RE
EAGER
FOR
THIS
NEWS
WE
NOTICE
IT
THE
FEW
TIMES
IT
HAPPENS
WHAT
INTERESTING
ABOUT
THE
FOLKS
I
MEET
WHO
ARE
ENGAGED
AND
ARE
CLEARLY
HERETICS
IS
THAT
THEY
VE
ACTIVELY
TALKED
THEMSELVES
OUT
OF
THE
FEAR
I
MEAN
THE
FEAR
IS
STILL
THERE
BUT
IT
DROWNED
OUT
BY
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
IT
THE
STORY
OF
SUCCESS
OF
DRIVE
OF
DOING
SOMETHING
THAT
MATTERS
IT
AN
INTELLECTUAL
STORY
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
WORLD
OR
YOUR
INDUSTRY
OR
YOUR
PROJECT
NEEDS
AND
HOW
YOUR
INSIGHT
CAN
HELP
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
I
BELIEVE
YOU
CAN
TALK
OVER
THE
FEAR
LAYING
OUT
A
GAME
PLAN
THAT
MAKES
THE
FEAR
OBSOLETE
IT
NOT
ABOUT
SOME
CLEVER
TACTIC
OR
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
WRITE
A
MEMO
TO
YOUR
BOSS
IT
ABOUT
MAKING
IT
CLEAR
TO
YOURSELF
AND
TO
OTHERS
THAT
THE
WORLD
IS
NOW
DEMANDING
THAT
WE
CHANGE
AND
FAST
WAIT
WE
NEED
TO
STOP
AGAIN
IT
CLEAR
THAT
JUST
A
FEW
PARAGRAPHS
AREN
T
GOING
TO
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
UNDO
A
LIFETIME
OF
HAVING
FEAR
BEATEN
INTO
YOU
SO
STOP
FOR
A
SECOND
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
THE
ONLY
SHORTCUT
IN
THIS
BOOK
THE
ONLY
TECHNIQUE
OR
HOW
TO
OR
INSIDE
INFO
IS
THIS
THE
LEVERS
ARE
HERE
THE
PROOF
IS
HERE
THE
POWER
IS
HERE
THE
ONLY
THING
HOLDING
YOU
BACK
IS
YOUR
OWN
FEAR
NOT
EASY
TO
ADMIT
BUT
ESSENTIAL
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PETER
PRINCIPLE
REVISITED
DR
LAURENCE
PETER
IS
FAMOUS
FOR
PROPOSING
THAT
IN
A
HIERARCHY
EVERY
EMPLOYEE
TENDS
TO
RISE
TO
HIS
LEVEL
OF
INCOMPETENCE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WHEN
YOU
DO
A
GREAT
JOB
YOU
GET
PROMOTED
AND
THAT
PROCESS
REPEATS
ITSELF
UNTIL
FINALLY
YOU
END
UP
IN
A
JOB
YOU
CAN
T
HANDLE
I
D
LIKE
TO
PARAPHRASE
THE
PETER
PRINCIPLE
I
THINK
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
IN
EVERY
ORGANIZATION
EVERYONE
RISES
TO
THE
LEVEL
AT
WHICH
THEY
BECOME
PARALYZED
WITH
FEAR
THE
ESSENCE
OF
LEADERSHIP
IS
BEING
AWARE
OF
YOUR
FEAR
AND
SEEING
IT
IN
THE
PEOPLE
YOU
WISH
TO
LEAD
NO
IT
WON
T
GO
AWAY
BUT
AWARENESS
IS
THE
KEY
TO
MAKING
PROGRESS
WHEN
IT
ALL
FALLS
APART
IT
SO
COMMON
BUT
IT
DOESN
T
REALLY
HAVE
A
NAME
I
M
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
STRUGGLE
FOR
YEARS
BUT
NEVER
SEEM
TO
GET
ANYWHERE
THIS
LACK
OF
TRACTION
IS
OFTEN
MOST
NOTICEABLE
IN
SMALL
BUSINESSES
BUT
YOU
LL
ALSO
FIND
IT
AT
WELL
MEANING
NONPROFITS
AND
LARGE
CORPORATIONS
YOU
WORK
AND
WORK
FOLLOWING
ALL
THE
RULES
PUSHING
REALLY
HARD
BUT
NOTHING
HAPPENS
ALL
PAIN
NO
GAIN
WHAT
HAPPENING
I
THINK
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
BECOMING
EVER
BETTER
AT
FOLLOWING
BUT
ARE
NEVER
LEARNING
TO
LEAD
THEY
RE
FOLLOWING
INSTRUCTIONS
FOLLOWING
DIRECTIONS
FOLLOWING
THE
PACK
AND
HONING
THEIR
SKILLS
BUT
HIDING
HIDING
FROM
THE
FEAR
OF
LEADING
WHEN
YOU
ARE
LEADING
A
TRIBE
A
TRIBE
THAT
YOU
BELONG
TO
THE
BENEFITS
INCREASE
THE
WORK
GETS
EASIER
AND
THE
RESULTS
ARE
MORE
OBVIOUS
THAT
THE
BEST
REASON
TO
OVERCOME
THE
FEAR
WORTH
CRITICIZING
A
REMARKABLE
PRODUCT
OR
SERVICE
IS
LIKE
A
PURPLE
COW
BROWN
COWS
ARE
BORING
PURPLE
ONES
ARE
WORTH
MENTIONING
THOSE
IDEAS
SPREAD
THOSE
ORGANIZATIONS
GROW
THE
ESSENCE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENING
IN
THE
MARKET
TODAY
REVOLVES
AROUND
CREATING
PURPLE
COWS
HERE
THE
MARKETING
MATH
IDEAS
THAT
SPREAD
WIN
BORING
IDEAS
DON
T
SPREAD
BORING
ORGANIZATIONS
DON
T
GROW
WORKING
IN
AN
ENVIRONMENT
THAT
STATIC
IS
NO
FUN
EVEN
WORSE
WORKING
FOR
AN
ORGANIZATION
THAT
IS
BUSY
FIGHTING
OFF
CHANGE
IS
HORRIBLE
SO
WHY
HAVEN
T
YOU
AND
YOUR
TEAM
LAUNCHED
AS
MANY
PURPLE
COWS
AS
YOU
D
LIKE
FEAR
OF
FAILURE
IS
OVERRATED
FEAR
OF
FAILURE
IS
ACTUALLY
OVERRATED
AS
AN
EXCUSE
WHY
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
WORK
FOR
SOMEONE
THEN
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
NOT
THE
ACTUAL
COST
OF
THE
FAILURE
IS
ABSORBED
BY
THE
ORGANIZATION
NOT
BY
YOU
IF
YOUR
PRODUCT
LAUNCH
FAILS
THEY
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
FIRE
YOU
THE
COMPANY
WILL
MAKE
A
BIT
LESS
MONEY
AND
WILL
MOVE
ON
WHAT
PEOPLE
ARE
AFRAID
OF
ISN
T
FAILURE
IT
BLAME
CRITICISM
WE
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
BE
REMARKABLE
BECAUSE
WE
RE
WORRIED
ABOUT
CRITICISM
WE
HESITATE
TO
CREATE
INNOVATIVE
MOVIES
LAUNCH
NEW
HUMAN
RESOURCE
INITIATIVES
DESIGN
A
MENU
THAT
MAKES
DINERS
TAKE
NOTICE
OR
GIVE
AN
AUDACIOUS
SERMON
BECAUSE
WE
RE
WORRIED
DEEP
DOWN
THAT
SOMEONE
WILL
HATE
IT
AND
CALL
US
ON
IT
THAT
THE
STUPIDEST
THING
I
VE
EVER
HEARD
WHAT
A
WASTE
OF
MONEY
WHO
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
SOMETIMES
THE
CRITICISM
DOESN
T
EVEN
HAVE
TO
BE
THAT
OBVIOUS
THE
FEAR
OF
HEARING
I
M
SURPRISED
YOU
LAUNCHED
THIS
WITHOUT
DOING
MORE
RESEARCH
IS
ENOUGH
TO
GET
MANY
PEOPLE
TO
DO
A
LOT
MORE
RESEARCH
TO
STUDY
SOMETHING
TO
DEATH
AND
THEN
KILL
IT
HEY
AT
LEAST
YOU
DIDN
T
GET
CRITICIZED
FEAR
OF
CRITICISM
IS
A
POWERFUL
DETERRENT
BECAUSE
THE
CRITICISM
DOESN
T
ACTUALLY
HAVE
TO
OCCUR
FOR
THE
FEAR
TO
SET
IN
WATCH
A
FEW
PEOPLE
GET
CRITICIZED
FOR
BEING
INNOVATIVE
AND
IT
PRETTY
EASY
TO
CONVINCE
YOURSELF
THAT
THE
VERY
SAME
THING
WILL
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
RE
NOT
CAREFUL
CONSTRUCTIVE
CRITICISM
OF
COURSE
IS
A
TERRIFIC
TOOL
IF
A
CRITIC
TELLS
YOU
I
DON
T
LIKE
IT
OR
THIS
IS
DISAPPOINTING
HE
DONE
NO
GOOD
AT
ALL
IN
FACT
QUITE
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
TRUE
HE
USED
HIS
POWER
TO
INJURE
WITHOUT
GIVING
YOU
ANY
INFORMATION
TO
HELP
YOU
DO
BETTER
NEXT
TIME
WORSE
HE
HASN
T
GIVEN
THOSE
LISTENING
ANY
DATA
WITH
WHICH
TO
MAKE
A
THOUGHTFUL
DECISION
ON
THEIR
OWN
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
BY
REFUSING
TO
REVEAL
THE
BASIS
FOR
HIS
CRITICISM
HE
BEING
A
COWARD
BECAUSE
THERE
NO
WAY
TO
CHALLENGE
HIS
OPINION
I
ADMIT
IT
WHEN
I
GET
A
BAD
REVIEW
MY
FEELINGS
ARE
HURT
AFTER
ALL
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
EVERY
CRITIC
SAID
A
TITLE
OF
MINE
WAS
A
BREAKTHROUGH
AN
INSPIRATIONAL
THOUGHTFUL
BOOK
THAT
EXPLAINS
HOW
EVERYTHING
WORKS
BUT
SOMETIMES
THEY
DON
T
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
ENOUGH
TO
RUIN
MY
DAY
BUT
IT
NOT
ENOUGH
IT
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
RUIN
MY
DAY
BECAUSE
I
REALIZE
THAT
MY
BOOK
GOT
NOTICED
MOST
PEOPLE
LOVED
IT
A
FEW
HATED
IT
BUT
BY
AND
LARGE
MOST
BOOKS
ARE
IGNORED
ONE
BAD
REVIEW
DOESN
T
RUIN
MY
DAY
BECAUSE
I
REALIZE
WHAT
A
BADGE
OF
HONOR
IT
IS
TO
GET
A
BIT
OF
CRITICISM
AT
ALL
IT
MEANS
THAT
I
CONFOUNDED
EXPECTATIONS
THAT
I
DIDN
T
DELIVER
THE
SEQUEL
OR
THE
SIMPLE
PRACTICAL
GUIDE
THAT
SOME
EXPECTED
IT
MEANS
THAT
IN
FACT
I
DID
SOMETHING
WORTH
REMARKING
ON
THE
LESSON
HERE
IS
THIS
IF
I
HAD
WRITTEN
A
BORING
BOOK
THERE
D
BE
NO
CRITICISM
NO
CONVERSATION
THE
PRODUCTS
AND
SERVICES
THAT
GET
TALKED
ABOUT
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
ARE
WORTH
TALKING
ABOUT
HOW
WAS
YOUR
DAY
IF
YOUR
ANSWER
IS
FINE
THEN
I
DON
T
THINK
YOU
WERE
LEADING
SO
THE
CHALLENGE
AS
YOU
CONTEMPLATE
YOUR
NEXT
OPPORTUNITY
TO
BE
BORING
OR
REMARKABLE
IS
TO
ANSWER
THESE
TWO
QUESTIONS
IF
I
GET
CRITICIZED
FOR
THIS
WILL
I
SUFFER
ANY
MEASURABLE
IMPACT
WILL
I
LOSE
MY
JOB
GET
HIT
UPSIDE
THE
HEAD
WITH
A
SOFTBALL
BAT
OR
LOSE
IMPORTANT
FRIENDSHIPS
IF
THE
ONLY
SIDE
EFFECT
OF
THE
CRITICISM
IS
THAT
YOU
WILL
FEEL
BAD
ABOUT
THE
CRITICISM
THEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
COMPARE
THAT
BAD
FEELING
WITH
THE
BENEFITS
YOU
LL
GET
FROM
ACTUALLY
DOING
SOMETHING
WORTH
DOING
BEING
REMARKABLE
IS
EXCITING
FUN
PROFITABLE
AND
GREAT
FOR
YOUR
CAREER
FEELING
BAD
WEARS
OFF
AND
THEN
ONCE
YOU
VE
COMPARED
THE
BAD
FEELING
AND
THE
BENEFITS
AND
YOU
VE
SOLD
YOURSELF
ON
TAKING
THE
REMARKABLE
PATH
ANSWER
THIS
ONE
HOW
CAN
I
CREATE
SOMETHING
THAT
CRITICS
WILL
CRITICIZE
THE
CULT
OF
THE
HERETIC
HERETICS
ARE
ENGAGED
PASSIONATE
AND
MORE
POWERFUL
AND
HAPPIER
THAN
EVERYONE
ELSE
AND
THEY
HAVE
A
TRIBE
THAT
THEY
SUPPORT
AND
THAT
SUPPORTS
THEM
IN
TURN
CHALLENGING
THE
STATUS
QUO
REQUIRES
A
COMMITMENT
BOTH
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
IT
INVOLVES
REACHING
OUT
TO
OTHERS
AND
PUTTING
YOUR
IDEAS
ON
THE
LINE
OR
PINNING
YOUR
NINETY
FIVE
THESES
TO
THE
CHURCH
DOOR
HERETICS
MUST
BELIEVE
MORE
THAN
ANYONE
ELSE
IN
AN
ORGANIZATION
IT
THE
PERSON
WHO
CHALLENGING
THE
STATUS
QUO
THE
ONE
WHO
IS
DARING
TO
BE
GREAT
WHO
IS
TRULY
PRESENT
AND
NOT
JUST
PUNCHING
A
CLOCK
WHO
MUST
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
HER
BELIEFS
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
STEVE
JOBS
SHOWING
UP
FOR
THE
PAYCHECK
IT
NICE
TO
GET
PAID
IT
ESSENTIAL
TO
BELIEVE
SHOULD
THEY
BUILD
A
STATUE
OF
YOU
HOW
MUCH
EGO
IS
INVOLVED
IN
BEING
A
LEADER
DAVID
CHANG
IS
A
FANTASTIC
CHEF
WITH
A
LOYAL
TRIBE
HIS
RESTAURANTS
ARE
BLOGGED
ABOUT
INCESSANTLY
AND
PEOPLE
SPEND
HOURS
TRYING
TO
GET
IN
TO
THEM
THEY
TAKE
PHOTOS
OF
THE
ITEMS
HE
MAKES
AND
POST
THEM
ONLINE
TOGETHER
WITH
REVIEWS
LIKE
DAVID
CHANG
IS
A
GENIUS
IT
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
IF
THEY
BUILT
STATUES
FOR
CHEFS
THEY
D
BUILD
ONE
FOR
DAVID
BUT
IS
DAVID
DOING
IT
FOR
THE
GLORY
OR
IS
HE
DOING
IT
FOR
THE
TRIBE
I
THINK
YOU
KNOW
THE
ANSWER
GREAT
LEADERS
FOCUS
ON
THE
TRIBE
AND
ONLY
THE
TRIBE
PEMA
CHODRON
IS
A
BUDDHIST
NUN
WORKING
IN

MONASTERY
IN

MILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
ACROSS
THE
WORLD
REVERE
HER
WORK
READ
HER
BOOKS
LISTEN
TO
HER
RECORDINGS
AND
VISIT
HER
IF
THEY
CAN
IS
SHE
A
RAGING
EGOMANIAC
OF
COURSE
NOT
LISTEN
TO
HER
FOR
THREE
MINUTES
AND
YOU
LL
KNOW
THAT
SHE
NOT
DOING
WHAT
SHE
DOES
FOR
GLORY
SHE
DOING
IT
TO
HELP
WHICH
IS
TRUE
OF
ALL
GREAT
LEADERS
FROM
DAVID
CHANG
IN
HIS
NEW

CITY
KITCHEN
TO
NANCY
PEARL
SEATTLE
FAVORITE
LIBRARIAN
THEY
RE
GENEROUS
THEY
EXIST
TO
HELP
THE
TRIBE
FIND
SOMETHING
TO
ENABLE
THE
TRIBE
TO
THRIVE
BUT
THEY
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
MOST
POWERFUL
WAY
TO
ENABLE
IS
TO
BE
STATUEWORTHY
BY
GETTING
OUT
FRONT
BY
MAKING
A
POINT
BY
CHALLENGING
CONVENTION
AND
BY
SPEAKING
UP
THOSE
ARE
BRAVE
ACTS
AND
BRAVERY
BEGETS
STATUES
IT
EASY
TO
HESITATE
WHEN
CONFRONTED
WITH
THE
FEELING
THAT
MAYBE
YOU
RE
GETTING
TOO
MUCH
ATTENTION
GREAT
LEADERS
ARE
ABLE
TO
REFLECT
THE
LIGHT
ONTO
THEIR
TEAMS
THEIR
TRIBES
GREAT
LEADERS
DON
T
WANT
THE
ATTENTION
BUT
THEY
USE
IT
THEY
USE
IT
TO
UNITE
THE
TRIBE
AND
TO
REINFORCE
ITS
SENSE
OF
PURPOSE
WHEN
YOU
ABUSE
THE
ATTENTION
YOU
ARE
TAKING
SOMETHING
FROM
THE
TRIBE
WHEN
FIDEL
CASTRO
GAVE
SIX
OR
SEVEN
HOUR
LONG
SPEECHES
WITH
MANDATORY
ATTENDANCE
HE
WAS
DIMINISHING
THE
ENERGY
OF
HIS
TRIBE
WHEN
A

TAKES
THE

NO

MEGHAN
HOWEVER

SHE
SOMEONE

SHE
REALIZES
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
CREATE
A

SHE
DOESN

THAT

BECAUSE
THERE

DECIDING

CHOICE
MEGHAN

SHE

THE
FIRST
THING
A

IS
THE

A

TACTICS

THE

A

IDEAS

QUICKLY
I
COULD

AN

IS
NOW

HE
WANTS

BE
IF
THE

THEY

THE

I
NEEDED
A

HAVE
TAKEN
THE

IDEA
BEHIND

AND
AMPLIFIED
IT
INTO
A
SET
OF
TOOLS
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
USE
TO
TIGHTEN
A

WITH

TINY
DRIPLIKE

THE

WHO

FACEBOOK
GOES
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
OF
TWITTER
INSTEAD
OF
FORCING
YOU
TO
USE
JUST
A
FEW
CHARACTERS
IT
ENABLES
A
HUGE
RANGE
OF

AND
CONNECTIONS
TO

ILLUMINATES
IT
WITH

BASECAMP
IS
A
THIRD
FORM
OF
ONLINE
INTERACTION
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
TWITTER
AND
FACEBOOK
IN
THAT
IT
QUITE
DELIBERATE
PERFECT
FOR
MANAGING
PROJECTS
AND
TRACKING
WORK
BY
ACCESSING
THE
STUFF
THAT
USED
TO
BE
IN
PRIVATE
E
MAILS
OR
HANDWRITTEN
JOURNALS
BASECAMP
MAKES
IT
EASY
FOR
THE
ENTIRE
TRIBE
TO
TRACK
PROGRESS
AND
FEEL
THE
MOMENTUM
THAT
YOU
RE
BUILDING
NOTHING
ONLINE
IS
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
A
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
THE
HARD
WORK
AND
GENEROSITY
THAT
COMES
FROM
LEADERSHIP
BUT
THESE
TOOLS
MAKE
LEADERSHIP
MORE
POWERFUL
AND
PRODUCTIVE
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
IN
YOUR
TRIBE
DISCOMFORT
LEADERSHIP
IS
SCARCE
BECAUSE
FEW
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
DISCOMFORT
REQUIRED
TO
LEAD
THIS
SCARCITY
MAKES
LEADERSHIP
VALUABLE
IF
EVERYONE
TRIES
TO
LEAD
ALL
THE
TIME
NOT
MUCH
HAPPENS
IT
DISCOMFORT
THAT
CREATES
THE
LEVERAGE
THAT
MAKES
LEADERSHIP
WORTHWHILE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
EVERYONE
COULD
DO
IT
THEY
WOULD
AND
IT
WOULDN
T
BE
WORTH
MUCH
IT
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
STAND
UP
IN
FRONT
OF
STRANGERS
IT
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
PROPOSE
AN
IDEA
THAT
MIGHT
FAIL
IT
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
CHALLENGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
IT
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
RESIST
THE
URGE
TO
SETTLE
WHEN
YOU
IDENTIFY
THE
DISCOMFORT
YOU
VE
FOUND
THE
PLACE
WHERE
A
LEADER
IS
NEEDED
IF
YOU
RE
NOT
UNCOMFORTABLE
IN
YOUR

AS
A

IT
ALMOST
CERTAIN
YOU
RE
NOT

YOUR

FOLLOWERS

A

TOO
AN

ANY

NEEDS
PEOPLE
WHO
AREN

JUST

TO

BUT
ARE
EAGER
TO
FOLLOW
I
THINK
THOUGH
IT
A
MISTAKE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOUR
BEST
TRIBE
RECRUITS
ARE
BLIND
SHEEP
FOLKS
WHO
DO
NOTHING
BUT
MINDLESSLY
FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS
LET
YOU
DOWN
IN
TWO
WAYS
FIRST
THEY
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
THE
LOCAL
LEADERSHIP
REQUIRED
WHEN
TRIBE
MEMBERS
INTERACT
THEY
RE
GOING
TO
BE
SO
BUSY
FOLLOWING
THE
PLAYBOOK
THAT
THEY
LL
HESITATE
ABOUT
ENGAGING
IN
THE
INTERACTIONS
THAT
MAKE
A
TIGHT
TRIBE
SUCH
A
VIBRANT
ORGANIZATION
PEOPLE
DON
T
ENGAGE
MERELY
TO
REMIND
ONE
ANOTHER
OF
THE
STATUS
QUO
INSTEAD
THEY
EAGERLY
ENGAGE
WHEN
THEY
WANT
SOMETHING
TO
IMPROVE
THIS
MICROLEADERSHIP
IS
ESSENTIAL
TO
THE
HEALTH
OF
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
SECOND
THEY
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
A
VERY
GOOD
JOB
OF
RECRUITING
NEW
MEMBERS
TO
YOUR
TRIBE
THAT
BECAUSE
EVANGELISM
REQUIRES
LEADERSHIP
LEADING
SOMEONE
TOWARD
GIVING
UP
ONE
WORLDVIEW
AND
EMBRACING
YOURS
ISN

EASY
AND
IT
NOT

IN

IT
THE

THEY

THE

OF

THAT

A

WITHIN

STARTING

THEY
CALLED
ON
THEIR

TO
CONTRIBUTE
AND

AND
THE
REST
THEY
LURKED
THEY
SAT
AND
THEY
WATCHED
THEY
WERE
HIDING
AFRAID
OF
SOMETHING
THAT
WASN

WHOM

HOW
COULD
THE

IMAGINE
THAT

WERE
THEY
HOPING
THAT

THE

WAS
PERFECT
IN

THERE
WERE

NO

NO

NOTHING

IT

THE

BETWEEN

MAY

IT

NONETHELESS
THEY
FOUND
A

DESPERATELY
WANTED

THEY
MADE
THE

SOME

BUDDIES
RATED
IT
QUITE
HIGHLY
IT
A
SMALL
PLACE
REQUIRING
US
TO

IS

CAUSE
I

THE

IT

WHICH
JUST
WASN

GOING

FOR

I
OPTED
FOR
EXTRA
PORK
THIS
RAMEN
IS
LIKE
A

OF
FATTY
PORK
IN
BUTTER
WITH
SOME
NOODLES
ADDED
FOR
TEXTURE
I
ADMIRE
THEIR
BRAVERY
IN
SERVING
THIS
TO
ME
IT
SHOULD
COME
WITH
A
CARTON
OF
NEWPORTS
FOR
CLEARLY
MY
HEALTH
IS
NOT
THEIR
CONCERN
THE
BROTH
THOUGH
FLAVORFUL
IS
OVERWHELMED
WITH
THE
FATNESS
OF
THE
PORK
HOWEVER
THE
PORK
IS
FANTASTIC
DELICIOUS
AND
COOKED
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
IT
FALLS
APART
I
DON
T
KNOW
ABOUT
YOU
BUT
I
WANT
IN
I
WANT
TO
EAT
AT
EVERY
ONE
OF
THESE
RESTAURANTS
I
WANT
TO

MY

I
WANT
TO

THIS

IF
THEY
ASK
ME
TO
PITCH
IN
I
WILL
I
M
IN
OTHERS
WILL
SCOFF
AND
MOVE
ON
WONDERING
WHAT
THE
OBSESSION
IS
ALL
ABOUT
THAT
WHAT
MAKES
IT
A
TRIBE
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
INSIDERS
AND
OUTSIDERS
CURIOSITY
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
A
PERSON
WHO
CONSIDERS
WHETHER
A
FACT
IS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
HIS
RELIGION
BEFORE
HE
EXPLORES
IT
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
CURIOUS
PERSON
WHO
EXPLORES
FIRST
AND
THEN
CONSIDERS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HE
WANTS
TO
ACCEPT
THE
RAMIFICATIONS
A
CURIOUS
PERSON
EMBRACES
THE
TENSION
BETWEEN
HIS
RELIGION
AND
SOMETHING
NEW
WRESTLES
WITH
IT
AND
THROUGH
IT
AND
THEN
DECIDES
WHETHER
TO
EMBRACE
THE
NEW
IDEA
OR
REJECT
IT
CURIOUS
IS
THE
KEY
WORD
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
INCOME
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
EDUCATION
AND
CERTAINLY
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ORGANIZED
RELIGION
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
A
DESIRE
TO
UNDERSTAND
A
DESIRE
TO
TRY
A
DESIRE
TO
PUSH
WHATEVER
ENVELOPE
IS
INTERESTING
LEADERS
ARE
CURIOUS
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
T
WAIT
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
THE
GROUP
IS
GOING
TO
DO
NEXT
THE
CHANGES
IN
THE
TRIBE
ARE
WHAT
ARE
INTERESTING
AND
CURIOSITY
DRIVES
THEM
CURIOUS
PEOPLE
COUNT
NOT
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
THEM
BUT
BECAUSE
THEY
RE
THE
ONES
WHO
TALK
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
IN
A
STUPOR
THEY
RE
THE
ONES
WHO
LEAD
THE
MASSES
IN
THE
MIDDLE
WHO
ARE
STUCK
THE
MASSES
IN
THE
MIDDLE
HAVE
BRAINWASHED
THEMSELVES
INTO
THINKING
IT
SAFE
TO
DO
NOTHING
WHICH
THE
CURIOUS
CAN
T
ABIDE
IT
EASY
TO
UNDERESTIMATE
HOW
DIFFICULT
IT
IS
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
BECOME
CURIOUS
FOR
SEVEN
TEN
OR
EVEN
FIFTEEN
YEARS
OF
SCHOOL
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
NOT
BE
CURIOUS
OVER
AND
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
THE
CURIOUS
ARE
PUNISHED
I
DON
T
THINK
IT
A
MATTER
OF
SAYING
A
MAGIC
WORD
BOOM
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY
SOMETHING
HAPPENS
AND
YOU
RE
CURIOUS
IT
MORE
ABOUT
A
FIVE
OR
TEN
OR
FIFTEEN
YEAR
PROCESS
WHERE
YOU
START
FINDING
YOUR
VOICE
AND
FINALLY
YOU
BEGIN
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
SAFEST
THING
YOU
CAN
DO
FEELS
RISKY
AND
THE
RISKIEST
THING
YOU
CAN
DO
IS
PLAY
IT
SAFE
ONCE
RECOGNIZED
THE
QUIET
YET
PERSISTENT
VOICE
OF
CURIOSITY
DOESN
T
GO
AWAY
EVER
AND
PERHAPS
IT
SUCH
CURIOSITY
THAT
WILL
LEAD
US
TO
DISTINGUISH
OUR
OWN
GREATNESS
FROM
THE
MEDIOCRITY
THAT
STARES
US
IN
THE
FACE
WHAT
WE
RE
SEEING
IS
THAT
FUNDAMENTALISM
REALLY
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
RELIGION
AND
EVERYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
AN
OUTLOOK
REGARDLESS
WHAT
YOUR
RELIGION
IS
THE
PLURALITY
MYTH
IN
ORDER
TO
WIN
AN
ELECTION
YOU
NEED
MORE
THAN
HALF
THE
VOTES
IDEALLY
MORE
THAN
HALF
OF
THE
POPULATION
WILL
SUPPORT
YOU
BUT
YOU
WIN
IF
YOU
GET
MORE
THAN
HALF
THE
VOTERS
IN
ORDER
TO
LEAD
A
TRIBE
NO
SUCH
RULE
APPLIES
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
IS
MOTIVATE
PEOPLE
WHO
CHOOSE

THE

WORLDVIEW

THE

THAT
GLOBAL
WARMING
IS
A
PROBLEM
AND
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
ADDRESSED
THROUGH
ITS

THEY
COME
TO
THE

WITH
THAT
IN
MIND
AND
YOUR

RESONATES
WITH
THEM
IF
ON

YOU
CHOOSE
TO

TO
PERSUADE
A

THEY

INSTEAD
THEY
REALIZE
THAT
A

TRIBE
IN

FACEBOOK
WORKS
PRECISELY
BECAUSE

YOU
HAVE
A

ONLY
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
YOU

BUT
BIGGER
ISN

THE
ANSWER
SOME

DO
BETTER
WHEN

MORE

HARDER
TO
GET
INTO

THRIVE

BECAUSE

IT

YOUR

MOST
PEOPLE
DON

SO
MUCH
MOST
PEOPLE
LIKE
THE
PRODUCTS
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
SO
MARKETERS
IGNORE
THEM
MOST
PEOPLE
WORK
HARD
TO
FIT
IN
SO
OTHERS
DON

NOTICE
THEM
MOST
PEOPLE
LIKE
EATING
AT
PLACES
WHERE
THEY
VE
EATEN
BEFORE
MOST
PEOPLE
THINK
THIS
BOOK
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
LIKE
THE
WORLD
TO
STAY
JUST
AS
IT
IS
BUT
CALMER
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
AFRAID
MOST
PEOPLE
DIDN

USE
GOOGLE
UNTIL
LAST

MOST
PEOPLE
AREN
T
CURIOUS
YOU
RE
NOT
MOST
PEOPLE
YOU
RE
NOT
THE
TARGET
MARKET
FOR
MOST
MARKETERS
AND
YOU
RE
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
MANAGER
NOT
ONLY
AREN
T
LEADERS
MOST
PEOPLE
BUT
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
TRIBES
AREN
T
MOST
PEOPLE
EITHER
YOU
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GROW
YOUR
CAREER
OR
YOUR
BUSINESS
OR
FEED
THE
TRIBE
BY
GOING
AFTER
MOST
PEOPLE
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
REALLY
GOOD
AT
IGNORING
NEW
TRENDS
OR
GREAT
EMPLOYEES
OR
BIG
IDEAS
YOU
CAN
WORRY
ABOUT
MOST
PEOPLE
ALL
DAY
BUT
I
PROMISE
YOU
THAT
THEY
RE
NOT
WORRIED
ABOUT
YOU
THEY
CAN
T
HEAR
YOU
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
HARD
YOU
YELL
ALMOST
ALL
THE
GROWTH
THAT
AVAILABLE
TO
YOU
EXISTS
WHEN
YOU
AREN
T
LIKE
MOST
PEOPLE
AND
WHEN
YOU
WORK
HARD
TO
APPEAL
TO
FOLKS
WHO
AREN
T
MOST
PEOPLE
DOES
THE
STATUS
QUO
RUIN
YOUR
DAY
EVERY
DAY
HOW
WAS
YOUR
DAY
ARE
YOU
STUCK
WITH
THE
WAY
THINGS
WERE
INSTEAD
OF
BUSY
TURNING
THINGS
INTO
WHAT
THEY
COULD
BE
HERETICS
HAVE
A
PLAN
THEY
UNDERSTAND
THAT
CHANGING
THE
STATUS
QUO
IS
NOT
ONLY
PROFITABLE
BUT
FUN
TOO
BEING
A
HERETIC
AN
OUTSIDER
AND
A
RABBLE
ROUSER
FEELS
SCARY
WHY
BOTHER
THEY
BURN
HERETICS
AT
THE
STAKE
THEY
ALSO
DROWN
THEM
DENOUNCE
THEM
IGNORE
THEM
AND
HANG
THEM
FROM
THE
RAFTERS
I
SHOULD
HAVE
USED
THE
PAST
TENSE
NONE
OF
THAT
IS
TRUE
ANYMORE
NOW
WE
INVITE
HERETICS
TO
DAVOS
HERETICS
GET
ELECTED
TO
CONGRESS
HERETICS
MAKE
A
FORTUNE
WHEN
THEIR
COMPANIES
GO
PUBLIC
HERETICS
NOT
ONLY
LOVE
THEIR
JOBS
THEY
GET
A
PRIVATE
JET
TOO
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
STAKE
IS
HARD
TO
FORGET
IT
TOUCHES
US
IN
A
WAY
THAT
ALMOST
PRIMAL
BUT
IT
ALSO
OBSOLETE
MARKETING
HAS
MADE
SURE
OF
THAT
THE
SAME
FORCES
THAT
TAUGHT
US
TO
DRINK
COKE
FOR
BREAKFAST
OR
SPEND
ON
A
HANDBAG
ARE
NOW
AT
WORK
ON
THE
STATUS
QUO
HERETICS
ARE
TOO
NUMEROUS
TO
BURN
AT
THE
STAKE
SO
WE
CELEBRATE
THEM
THE
WRONG
QUESTION
WE
RE
ALMOST
THERE
BUT
SOME
OF
YOU
ARE
ITCHING
TO
ASK
ME
EXACTLY
THE
WRONG
QUESTIONS
WHICH
ARE
HOW
DO
I
DO
THIS
OR
EVEN
WORSE
HOW
DO
I
GET
MY
BOSS
TO
LET
ME
DO
THIS
OR
TO
BE
REALLY
BLUNT
WHAT
THE
RISK
FREE
WAY
TO
INSINUATE
MYSELF
INTO
THE
SYSTEM
SO
I
GET
APPROVAL
TO
MAKE
CHANGE
SURELY
THERE
A
METHOD
OF
MAKING
CHANGE
WITHOUT
BEING
BURNED
AT
THE
STAKE
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
THERE
IS
BUT
YOU
ALREADY
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
BELIEF
NOBODY
IS
GOING
TO
LISTEN
TO
YOUR
IDEA
FOR
CHANGE
SAGELY
SHAKE
HIS
HEAD
AND
SAY
SURE
GO
DO
THAT
NO
ONE
ANOINTS
YOU
AS
LEADER
NOBODY
IS
GOING
TO
SEE
YOUR
POWERPOINT
PRESENTATION
AND
HAND
YOU
A
CHECK
CHANGE
ISN
T
MADE
BY
ASKING
PERMISSION
CHANGE
IS
MADE
BY
ASKING
FORGIVENESS
LATER
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
IS
TWO
THINGS
THE
FIRST
THING
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
IS
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
HAVE
FAR
MORE
POWER
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
IN
HISTORY
ONE
PERSON
CAN
CHANGE
AN
INDUSTRY
ONE
PERSON
CAN
DECLARE
WAR
ONE
PERSON
CAN
REINVENT
SCIENCE
OR
POLITICS
OR
TECHNOLOGY
THE
SECOND
THING
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
IS
THAT
THE
ONLY
THING
HOLDING
YOU
BACK
FROM
BECOMING
THE
KIND
OF
PERSON
WHO
CHANGES
THINGS
IS
THIS
LACK
OF
FAITH
FAITH
THAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IT
FAITH
THAT
IT
WORTH
DOING
FAITH
THAT
FAILURE
WON
T
DESTROY
YOU
OUR
CULTURE
WORKS
HARD
TO
PREVENT
CHANGE
WE
HAVE
LONG
HAD
SYSTEMS
AND
ORGANIZATIONS
AND
STANDARDS
DESIGNED
TO
DISSUADE
PEOPLE
FROM
CHALLENGING
THE
STATUS
QUO
WE
ENFORCE
OUR
SYSTEMS
AND
CALL
WHOEVER
IS
CRAZY
ENOUGH
TO
CHALLENGE
THEM
A
HERETIC
AND
SOCIETY
ENFORCES
THE
STANDARDS
BY
BURNING
ITS
HERETICS
AT
THE
STAKE
EITHER
LITERALLY
OR
FIGURATIVELY
BUT
THE
WORLD
HAS
CHANGED
A
LOT
THERE
ARE
HERETICS
EVERYWHERE
YOU
LOOK
IT
SO
ASYMMETRICAL
THAT
BURNING
HERETICS
ISN
T
PARTICULARLY
EFFECTIVE
ANY
LONGER
AS
A
RESULT
MORE
AND
MORE
PEOPLE
GOOD
PEOPLE
PEOPLE
ON
A
MISSION
PEOPLE
WITH
IDEAS
THAT
MATTER
ARE
STEPPING
FORWARD
AND
MAKING
A
DIFFERENCE
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
SYSTEM
WHETHER
IT
POLITICAL
FINANCIAL
OR
EVEN
RELIGIOUS
HAS
BECOME
ASYMMETRICAL
THE
PROCESS
HAS
TURNED
UPSIDE
DOWN
SCALE
ISN
T
THE
SAME
AS
POWER
IN
FACT
SCALE
CAN
HURT
WE
VE
SEEN
THIS
IN
THE
WAR
IN
IRAQ
AS
MUCH
AS
WE
VE
SEEN
IT
IN
THE
WAR
IN
THE
SODA
AISLE
OR
IN
THE
GROWTH
OF
NEW
RELIGIONS
IN
EACH
CASE
AN
INDIVIDUAL
OR
A
SMALL
GROUP
HAS
THE
POWER
TO
TURN
AN
EXISTING
SYSTEM
ON
ITS
HEAD
NOW
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
WE
CALL
HERETICS
LEADERS
THE
HERETICS
ARE
WINNING
YOU
CAN
AND
MUST
JOIN
THEM
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
AND
THE
UNICORN
I
M
NOT
SURE
YOU
VE
EVER
VISITED
A
BALLOON
FACTORY
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WORK
IN
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
ARE
TIMID
AFRAID
EVEN
THEY
RE
VERY
CONCERNED
ABOUT
PINS
NEEDLES
AND
PORCUPINES
THEY
DON
T
LIKE
SUDDEN
CHANGES
IN
TEMPERATURE
SHARP
OBJECTS
ARE
A
PROBLEM
AS
WELL
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
ISN
T
REALLY
A
BAD
PLACE
TO
WORK
IF
YOU
RATIONALIZE
A
BIT
IT
STEADY
WORK
WITH
A
BIT
OF
A
RUSH
AROUND
NEW
YEAR
THE
REST
OF
THE
TIME
IT
QUIET
AND
PEACEFUL
AND
NOT
SO
SCARY
EXCEPT
WHEN
THE
UNICORNS
SHOW
UP
AT
FIRST
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
FOLKS
SHUSH
THE
UNICORN
AND
WARN
HIM
AWAY
THAT
OFTEN
WORKS
BUT
SOMETIMES
THE
UNICORN
IGNORES
THEM
AND
WANDERS
INTO
THE
FACTORY
ANYWAY
THAT
WHEN
EVERYONE
RUNS
FOR
COVER
IT
AMAZINGLY
EASY
FOR
A
UNICORN
TO
COMPLETELY
DISRUPT
A
BALLOON
FACTORY
THAT
BECAUSE
THE
FACTORY
IS
ORGANIZED
AROUND
A
SINGLE
IDEA
THE
IDEA
OF
SOFT
QUIET
STABILITY
THE
UNICORN
CHANGES
ALL
THAT
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
IS
ALL
ABOUT
THE
STATUS
QUO
AND
LEADERS
CHANGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
LEADERS
ARE
GENEROUS
IN
TODAY
SUPERCHARGED
POLITICAL
AND
TV
ENVIRONMENT
IT
EASY
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
LEAD
YOU
NEED
TO
BE
AN
EGOMANIAC
A
DRIVEN
SUPERSTAR
INTENT
ON
SELF
GLORIFICATION
AND
AGGRANDIZEMENT
IN
FACT
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
NEARLY
ALWAYS
THE
CASE
LEADERS
WHO
SET
OUT
TO
GIVE
ARE
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
THAN
LEADERS
WHO
SEEK
TO
GET
EVEN
MORE
SURPRISING
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
LEADER
MATTERS
THE
TRIBES
CAN
SNIFF
OUT
WHY
SOMEONE
IS
ASKING
FOR
THEIR
ATTENTION
LOOKING
OUT
FOR
NUMBER
ONE
IS
AN
ATTITUDE
AND
IT
ONE
THAT
DOESN
T
PAY
SO
WE
HAVE
CEOS
WHO
SIT
IN
CUBICLES
JUST
LIKE
EVERYONE
ELSE
WE
FIND
SUCCESSFUL
RELIGIOUS
LEADERS
WHO
DON
T
FLY
BY
PRIVATE
JET
OR
HAVE
A
LIMO
WAITING
FOR
THEM
OUTSIDE
WE
WATCH
EIGHTY
FOURYEAR
OLD
FORMER
PRESIDENT
JIMMY
CARTER
BUILDING
HOUSES
FOR
THE
POOR
THE
BENEFITS
TO
THESE
LEADERS
AREN
T
MONETARY
OR
BASED
ON
STATUS
INSTEAD
THEY
GET
THEIR
COMPENSATION
FROM
WATCHING
THE
TRIBE
THRIVE
AS
THE
ABILITY
TO
LEAD
A
TRIBE
BECOMES
OPEN
TO
MORE
PEOPLE
IT
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THOSE
WHO
TAKE
THAT
OPPORTUNITY
AND
THOSE
WHO
SUCCEED
MOST
OFTEN
ARE
DOING
IT
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
THEY
CAN
DO
FOR
THE
TRIBE
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
THE
TRIBE
CAN
DO
FOR
THEM
DON
T
FORGET
THE
BIG
MAC
AND
THE
MICROWAVE
OVEN
IN
JUST
OUTSIDE
OF
PITTSBURGH
A
THIRD
TIER
MCDONALD
FRANCHISEE
NAMED
JIM
DELLIGATTI
BROKE
THE
RULES
AND
INVENTED
A
NEW
SANDWICH
WITHIN
A
YEAR
THE
BIG
MAC
WAS
ON
THE
MENU
OF
MCDONALD
RESTAURANTS
AROUND
THE
WORLD
THEY
EVEN
SERVE
A
MEATLESS
VERSION
IN
INDIA
JIM
WASN
T
FOCUSED
ON
MANAGING
HIS
FRANCHISE
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
EVERYTHING
ELSE
INSTEAD
HE
BECAME
A
LEADER
NOT
BLESSED
WITH
A
TITLE
OR
OFFICIAL
SANCTION
JIM
LED
THE
ENTIRE
CORPORATION
IN
A
NEW
DIRECTION
IN
PERCY
SPENCER
A
LOW
RANKING
ENGINEER
AT
THE
RAYTHEON
CORPORATION
WAS
TRYING
TO
IMPROVE
RADAR
TECHNOLOGY
WHEN
HE
ACCIDENTALLY
MELTED
A
CHOCOLATE
CANDY
BAR
BEING
PRETTY
SMART
PERCY
REALIZED
THAT
HE
HAD
INVENTED
THE
MICROWAVE
OVEN
NEXT
STEP
MICROWAVE
POPCORN
WITHIN
DECADES
THE
MICROWAVE
OVEN
WAS
A
MUST
HAVE
APPLIANCE
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
AMERICAN
HOME
THE
REMARKABLE
THING
ABOUT
THESE
TWO
STORIES
IS
HOW
RARE
THEY
ARE
WE
KEEP
HEARING
ABOUT
THE
INVENTION
OF
POST
IT
NOTES
AND
OTHER
APOCRYPHAL
TALES
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
THERE
AREN
T
THAT
MANY
TO
CHOOSE
FROM
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
IF
YOU
WANTED
TO
GET
SOMETHING
DONE
YOU
STARTED
AT
THE
TOP
OR
YOU
GOT
REALLY
LUCKY
LEVERAGE
CAME
FROM
CASH
AND
ORGANIZATIONAL
COMMITMENT
IF
BILL
GATES
OR
JACK
WELCH
OR
LYNDON
JOHNSON
THOUGHT
SOMETHING
WAS
A
GOOD
IDEA
IT
WAS
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
DONE
WELCOME
TO
THE
AGE
OF
LEVERAGE
BOTTOM
UP
IS
A
REALLY
BAD
WAY
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
BOTTOM
IN
AN
ERA
OF
GRASSROOTS
CHANGE
THE
TOP
OF
THE
PYRAMID
IS
TOO
FAR
AWAY
FROM
WHERE
THE
ACTION
IS
TO
MAKE
MUCH
OF
A
DIFFERENCE
IT
TAKES
TOO
LONG
AND
IT
LACKS
IMPACT
THE
TOP
ISN
T
THE
TOP
ANYMORE
BECAUSE
THE
STREETS
ARE
WHERE
THE
ACTION
IS
THE
NEW
LEVERAGE
AVAILABLE
TO
EVERYONE
MEANS
THAT
THE
STATUS
QUO
IS
MORE
THREATENED
THAN
EVER
AND
EACH
EMPLOYEE
NOW
HAS
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
CHANGE
THE
RULES
BEFORE
SOMEONE
ELSE
DOES
THIS
ISN
T
ABOUT
WORKING
YOUR
WAY
UP
TO
THE
TOP
BY
FOLLOWING
THE
RULES
AND
THEN
STARTING
DOWN
THE
PATH
OF
CHANGING
YOUR
WORLD
INSTEAD
THESE
INNOVATIONS
ARE
EXAMPLES
OF
LEADERSHIP
ABOUT
ONE
HERETIC
SOMEONE
WITH
A
VISION
WHO
UNDERSTOOD
THE
LEVERAGE
AVAILABLE
WHO
WENT
AHEAD
AND
CHANGED
THINGS
A
FEW
INDUSTRIES
DO
FINE
BY
EMBRACING
THE
STATUS
QUO
THE
LIST
IS
GETTING
SHORTER
EVERY
DAY
THOUGH
IF
YOU
SHIP
OIL
AROUND
THE
WORLD
OR
SELL
CREDIT
CARDS
OR
WANT
TO
GET
ELECTED
VILLAGE
SUPERVISOR
YOU
CAN
PROBABLY
COAST
FOR
A
WHILE
LONGER
EMBRACING
THE
OLD
RULES
BUT
NOT
THAT
MUCH
LONGER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
EVERY
FACTORY
IS
UNDER
PRESSURE
EVERY
BALLOON
MAKER
NOT
ONLY
FEARS
THE
UNICORN
BUT
DESPERATELY
NEEDS
ONE
KELLOGG
OWNS
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF

WORTH
OF
CEREAL
FACTORIES
THEY
HAVE
A
WELLTRAINED
SALES
FORCE
MILES
OF
SHELF

AND
TONS
OF

SO
WHY
WAS

NAKED
ABLE
TO
BUILD
A
SIGNIFICANT
BUSINESS
RIGHT
UNDER
THEIR
NOSE
WITHOUT
EXPENSIVE
FACTORIES
OR
A
HUGE
SALES
FORCE
BEAR
NAKED
TOOK
A
VERY
SIMPLE
VERY
TRADITIONAL

CHANGED
THE

MANY

DIDN

THEY

THEY

HAVE

TO
PROTECT
INSTEAD
THEY
LED
THE
WAY
DOWN
A
DIFFERENT
PATH
ONE
BASED
ON
FASHION
AND
CHANGE
AND
LEVERAGE
ODDS
ARE
THAT
GROWTH
AND
SUCCESS
ARE
NOW
INEXTRICABLY
LINKED
TO
BREAKING
THE

TO
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
ROCK
CLIMBING
PROBLEMS
SUDDENLY
IMPOSSIBLE
ROUTES
WEREN
T
IMPOSSIBLE
ANY
LONGER
THE
GUESS
IS
BECAUSE
CHRIS
FITS
THE
STEREOTYPE
OF
THE
TYPICAL
HERETIC
YOU
RE
NOT
CONVINCED
HE
A
LONER
HE
RISKING
HIS
LIFE
AND
DOING
ABSOLUTELY
ABSURD
THINGS
FORTY
FEET
OVER
THE
MEDITERRANEAN
AND
LANDING
ON
HIS
BACK
IN
THE
WATER
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
IT
EASY
TO
LOOK
AT
CHRIS
AND
SAY
I
COULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
AND
YOU
D
BE
RIGHT
YOU
AND
I
WILL
NEVER
DYNO
A
ROCK
ARCH
THE
LESSON
ISN
T
THAT
YOU
NEED
TO
RISK
YOUR
FINGERS
NOT
TO
MENTION
YOUR
LIFE
ON
A
ROCK
THE
LESSON
IS
THAT
ONE
PERSON
WITH
A
PERSISTENT
VISION
CAN
MAKE
CHANGE
HAPPEN
WHETHER
CLIMBING
ROCKS
OR
DELIVERING
SERVICES
HERE
A
SIMPLE
WAY
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
OBE
CARRION
FORMER
U
ROCK
CLIMBING
CHAMPION
WON
A
TOURNAMENT
IN
AN
UNUSUAL
WAY
OBE
WAS
ONE
OF
FOUR
FINALISTS
AND
EACH
HAD
TO
CLIMB
A
VERY
DIFFICULT
ROUTE
UP
A
STEEP
WALL
THE
FIRST
THREE
FINALISTS
DID
THE
SAME
THING
THEY
ENTERED
THE
ROPED
OFF
AREA
INSPECTED
THE
ROUTE
AND
THEN
SLOWLY
BEGAN
CLIMBING
ONE
HOLD
AT
A
TIME
WORKING
THEIR
WAY
UP
TO
THE
TOP
TWO
MADE
IT
WITH
A
SLIP
OR
TWO
ONE
FELL
OBE
WAS
SCHEDULED
TO
GO
LAST
HE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
ISOLATION
AREA
INSPECTED
THE
ROUTE
TOOK
TWENTY
STEPS
BACK
AND
HE
RAN
UP
THE
WALL
HE
DIDN
T
HESITATE
OR
INTERPOLATE
OR
HEDGE
HIS
BETS
HE
JUST
COMMITTED
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
EASIEST
WAY
UP
THE
WALL
LEANING
INTO
THE
PROBLEM
MADE
THE
PROBLEM
GO
AWAY
WHO
SETTLES
SETTLING
IS
NO
FUN
IT
A
MALIGNANT
HABIT
A
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
THAT
TAKES
YOU
TO
MEDIOCRITY
MANAGERS
SETTLE
ALL
THE
TIME
THEY
DON
T
REALLY
HAVE
A
CHOICE
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
COMPETING
PRIORITIES
HERETICS
DON
T
SETTLE
THEY
RE
NOT
GOOD
AT
THAT
MANAGERS
WHO
ARE
STUCK
WHO
COMPROMISE
TO
KEEP
THINGS
QUIET
WHO
BATTLE
THE
BUREAUCRACY
EVERY
DAY
THEY
RE
THE
ONES
WHO
SETTLE
WHAT
ELSE
CAN
THEY
DO
THE
ART
OF
LEADERSHIP
IS
UNDERSTANDING
WHAT
YOU
CAN
T
COMPROMISE
ON
FEAR
FAITH
AND
RELIGION
PEOPLE
WHO
CHALLENGE
AND
THEN
CHANGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
DO
SOMETHING
THAT
QUITE
DIFFICULT
THEY
OVERCOME
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
PEOPLE
THEY
TRUST
PEOPLE
THEY
WORK
FOR
PEOPLE
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITY
EVERY
STEP
ALONG
THE
WAY
IT
FAR
EASIER
TO
STOP
AND
ACCEPT
THE
THANKS
OF
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
WORKERS
FOR
FINALLY
GIVING
UP
THAN
IT
IS
TO
PERSIST
AND
RISK
THE
HUMILIATION
OF
FAILURE
SO
WHY
DO
IT
FAITH
IS
THE
UNSTATED
COMPONENT
IN
THE
WORK
OF
A
LEADER
AND
I
THINK
FAITH
IS
UNDERRATED
PARADOXICALLY
RELIGION
IS
VASTLY
OVERRATED
FAITH
GOES
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
FAITH
LEADS
TO
HOPE
AND
IT
OVERCOMES
FEAR
FAITH
GAVE
OUR
ANCESTORS
THE
RESILIENCE
THEY
NEEDED
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
PRE
SCIENCE
WORLD
FAITH
IS
THE
DIVIDING
LINE
BETWEEN
HUMANS
AND
MOST
OTHER
SPECIES
WE
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
THE
SUN
WILL
RISE
TOMORROW
FAITH
THAT
NEWTON
LAWS
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
GOVERN
THE
WAY
A
BALL
TRAVELS
AND
FAITH
THAT
OUR
TIME
IN
MED
SCHOOL
WILL
PAY
OFF
TWENTY
YEARS
FROM
NOW
BECAUSE
SOCIETY
IS
STILL
GOING
TO
NEED
DOCTORS
CHRIS
SHARMA
IS
ABLE
TO
DO
A
DYNO
ON
A
ROCK
FACE
ONE
HUNDRED
FEET
ABOVE
GROUND
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
FAITH
THAT
IT
LL
WORK
OUT
OKAY
IF
YOU
WATCH
KIDS
LEARNING
HOW
TO
DYNO
YOU
LL
SEE
THAT
THE
SECRET
TO
DEVELOPING
THE
SKILL
ISN
T
ABOUT
BUILDING
THEIR
MUSCLES
OR
LEARNING
SOME
EXOTIC
TECHNIQUE
IT
IS
MERELY
ABOUT
DEVELOPING
THE
FAITH
THAT
IT
LL
WORK
MERELY
OF
COURSE
IS
A
HUGE
STEP
IT
NOTHING
BUT
A
FEW
NEURONS
WORTH
OF
FAITH
JUST
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IT
BUT
WITHOUT
FAITH
THE
LEAP
NEVER
WORKS
FAITH
IS
CRITICAL
TO
ALL
INNOVATION
WITHOUT
FAITH
IT
SUICIDAL
TO
BE
A
LEADER
TO
ACT
LIKE
A
HERETIC
RELIGION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
REPRESENTS
A
STRICT
SET
OF
RULES
THAT
OUR
FELLOW
HUMANS
HAVE
OVERLAID
ON
TOP
OF
OUR
FAITH
RELIGION
SUPPORTS
THE
STATUS
QUO
AND
ENCOURAGES
US
TO
FIT
IN
NOT
TO
STAND
OUT
THERE
ARE
COUNTLESS
RELIGIONS
IN
OUR
LIVES
NOT
JUST
THE
CAPITAL
R
RELIGIONS
LIKE
ZOROASTRIANISM
OR
JUDAISM
THERE
THE
IBM
RELIGION
OF
THE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHICH
INCLUDED
WORKPLACE
PROTOCOLS
DRESS
CODES
AND
EVEN
A
PRECISE
METHOD
FOR
PRESENTING
IDEAS
ON
AN
OVERHEAD
PROJECTOR
THERE
THE
RELIGION
OF
BROADWAY
WHICH
DETERMINES
WHAT
A
MUSICAL
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
LOOK
AND
FEEL
LIKE
THERE
THE
RELIGION
OF
THE
MBA
RIGHT
DOWN
TO
THE
STANDARD
CURRICULUM
AND
PERCEPTIONS
OF
WHAT
IS
SUCCESSFUL
A
JOB
AT
BAIN
COMPANY
AND
WHAT
SORT
OF
FLAKY
GOING
TO
WORK
FOR
A
BREWERY
RELIGION
WORKS
GREAT
WHEN
IT
AMPLIFIES
FAITH
THAT
WHY
HUMAN
BEINGS
INVENTED
RELIGION
IT
WHY
WE
HAVE
SPIRITUAL
RELIGIONS
AND
CULTURAL
RELIGIONS
AND
CORPORATE
RELIGIONS
RELIGION
GIVES
OUR
FAITH
A
LITTLE
SUPPORT
WHEN
IT
NEEDS
IT
AND
IT
MAKES
IT
EASY
FOR
YOUR
PEERS
TO
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
EMBRACE
YOUR
FAITH
RELIGION
AT
ITS
BEST
IS
A
SORT
OF
MANTRA
A
SUBTLE
BUT
CONSISTENT
REMINDER
THAT
BELIEF
IS
OKAY
AND
THAT
FAITH
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GET
WHERE
YOU
RE
GOING
THE
REASON
WE
NEED
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THIS
THOUGH
IS
THAT
OFTEN
RELIGION
DOES
JUST
THE
OPPOSITE
RELIGION
AT
ITS
WORST
REINFORCES
THE
STATUS
QUO
OFTEN
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
OUR
FAITH
THEY
HAD
A
RELIGION
AT
WOOLWORTH
DEPARTMENT
STORE
AND
STICKING
WITHOUT
VARIATION
TO
THE
PRINCIPLES
THAT
MADE
THE
STORE
GREAT
PREVENTED
THEM
FROM
TURNING
IT
INTO
A
NEW
BETTER
KIND
OF
EXPERIENCE
THE
STORE
IS
LONG
GONE
OF
COURSE
THEY
HAVE
A
RELIGION
AT
THE
COUNTRY
CLUB
DOWN
THE
STREET
AS
WELL
A
SET
OF
CONVICTIONS
AND
RULES
THAT
IS
JUST
TOO
HARD
TO
CHANGE
AS
A
RESULT
AN
ENTIRE
GENERATION
OF
PROFESSIONAL
WOMEN
WON
T
JOIN
THAT
CLUB
AND
IT
GOING
TO
FADE
AND
BLOW
AWAY
SOON
CHALLENGE
RELIGION
AND
PEOPLE
WONDER
IF
YOU
RE
CHALLENGING
THEIR
FAITH
THE
REASON
IT
SO
DIFFICULT
TO
HAVE
A
CONSIDERED
CONVERSATION
ABOUT
RELIGION
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
FEEL
THREATENED
NOT
BY
THE
IMPLIED
CRITICISM
OF
THE
RITUALS
OR
IRRATIONALITY
OF
A
PARTICULAR
RELIGIOUS
PRACTICE
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
FEELS
LIKE
CRITICISM
OF
THEIR
FAITH
FAITH
AS
WE
VE
SEEN
IS
THE
CORNERSTONE
THAT
KEEPS
OUR
ORGANIZATIONS
TOGETHER
FAITH
IS
THE
CORNERSTONE
OF
HUMANITY
WE
CAN
T
LIVE
WITHOUT
IT
BUT
RELIGION
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
FAITH
RELIGION
IS
JUST
A
SET
OF
INVENTED
PROTOCOLS
RULES
TO
LIVE
BY
FOR
NOW
HERETICS
CHALLENGE
A
GIVEN
RELIGION
BUT
DO
IT
FROM
A
VERY
STRONG
FOUNDATION
OF
FAITH
IN
ORDER
TO
LEAD
YOU
MUST
CHALLENGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
OF
THE
RELIGION
YOU
RE
LIVING
UNDER
OF
COURSE
RELIGION
AND
FAITH
GO
TOGETHER
YOU
CAN
REMIND
YOURSELF
OF
YOUR
FAITH
BY
WEARING
THE
COMPANY
UNIFORM
OR
UTTERING
THE
MANTRA
OF
YOUR
CURRENT
RELIGION
YOU
CAN
EMBRACE
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
BY
SHOWING
UP
AT
CHURCH
OR
AT
THE
COMPANY
PICNIC
AND
FOLLOWING
THE
RITUALS
OF
WHICHEVER
RELIGION
IS
BEING
PRACTICED
WITHOUT
RELIGION
IT
EASIER
FOR
FAITH
TO
FLAG
IT
NO
WONDER
THAT
RELIGION
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
FOREVER
IT
REINFORCES
FAITH
AND
WE
CAN
T
SUCCEED
WITHOUT
IT
SO
SUCCESSFUL
HERETICS
CREATE
THEIR
OWN
RELIGIONS
FAST
COMPANY
MAGAZINE
WAS
A
NEW
TESTAMENT
FOR
A
NEW
RELIGION
IT
BROUGHT
TOGETHER
A
NEW
GROUP
OF
FRIENDS
NEW
SUPPORTERS
NEW
RITUALS
THE
SAME
THING
HAPPENS
AT
COMPANIES
THAT
EMBRACE
HERETICAL
BEHAVIOR
LIKE
IDEO
AND
AT
BLOGS
OR
EVEN
AT
BUCK
RESTAURANT
IN
SILICON
VALLEY
OR
THE
TED
CONFERENCE
OR
OTHER
PLACES
WHERE
LEADERS
LIKE
TO
HANG
OUT
THESE
RELIGIONS
EXIST
FOR
ONE
REASON
TO
REINFORCE
OUR
FAITH
YOU
CAN
DO
THIS
ON
PURPOSE
YOU
CAN
RECOGNIZE
THE
NEED
FOR
FAITH
IN
YOUR
IDEA
YOU
CAN
FIND
THE
TRIBE
YOU
NEED
TO
SUPPORT
YOU
AND
YES
YOU
CAN
CREATE
A
NEW
RELIGION
AROUND
YOUR
FAITH
STEVE
JOBS
DID
IT
ON
PURPOSE
AT
APPLE
AND
PHIL
KNIGHT
IS
FAMOUS
FOR
DOING
IT
AT
NIKE
SWITCHING
RELIGIONS
WITHOUT
GIVING
UP
FAITH
A
RECENT
STUDY
BY
THE
PEW
RESEARCH
CENTER
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
PRESS
FOUND
THAT
ABOUT
A
THIRD
OF
ALL
AMERICANS
HAVE
LEFT
THE
RELIGION
THEY
GREW
UP
WITH
THE
STUDY
MISTAKENLY
USES
THE
WORD
FAITH
BUT
IN
FACT
FEW
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
HAVE
LOST
FAITH
WHAT
THEY
VE
DONE
INSTEAD
IS
CHANGE
THE
SYSTEM
THEY
USE
FOR
REINFORCING
THAT
FAITH
WHEN
YOU
FALL
IN
LOVE
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
YOU
LOSE
THE
ABILITY
TO
GROW
FAITH
IS
WHAT
YOU
DO
IF
RELIGION
COMPRISES
RULES
YOU
FOLLOW
FAITH
IS
DEMONSTRATED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
YOU
TAKE
WHEN
YOU
LEAD
WITHOUT
COMPENSATION
WHEN
YOU
SACRIFICE
WITHOUT
GUARANTEES
WHEN
YOU
TAKE
RISKS
BECAUSE
YOU
BELIEVE
THEN
YOU
ARE
DEMONSTRATING
YOUR
FAITH
IN
THE
TRIBE
AND
ITS
MISSION
OF
COURSE
IT
DIFFICULT
BUT
LEADERS
WILL
TELL
YOU
THAT
IT
WORTH
IT
A
WORD
FOR
IT
RELIGION
AND
FAITH
ARE
OFTEN
CONFUSED
SOMEONE
WHO
OPPOSES
FAITH
IS
CALLED
AN
ATHEIST
AND
WIDELY
REVILED
BUT
WE
DON
T
HAVE
A
COMMON
WORD
FOR
SOMEONE
WHO
OPPOSES
A
PARTICULAR
RELIGION
HERETIC
WILL
HAVE
TO
DO
IF
FAITH
IS
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
A
BELIEF
SYSTEM
THEN
RELIGION
IS
THE
FAÇADE
AND
THE
LANDSCAPING
IT
EASY
TO
GET
CAUGHT
UP
IN
THE
FOIBLES
OF
A
CORPORATE
CULTURE
AND
THE
SYSTEMS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
BUILT
OVER
TIME
BUT
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
AT
ALL
TO
DO
WITH
THE
FAITH
THAT
BUILT
THE
SYSTEM
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
CHANGE
IS
MADE
BY
PEOPLE
BY
LEADERS
WHO
ARE
PROUD
TO
BE
CALLED
HERETICS
BECAUSE
THEIR
FAITH
IS
NEVER
IN
QUESTION
IN
THE
YEAR
THE
COUNCIL
OF
TRENT
WROTE
THIS
ABOUT
HERETICS
FINALLY
ALL
THE
FAITHFUL
ARE
COMMANDED
NOT
TO
PRESUME
TO
READ
OR
POSSESS
ANY
BOOKS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
PRESCRIPTIONS
OF

INCURS
IMMEDIATELY
THE

BOY
ARE
YOU
IN

BETTER
GET
RID
OF
THIS
BOOK
OVER
THE
TOP
UNDERDOG
BRAVERY
FOR
ABOUT
A
DECADE
I
VE
CARRIED
A
COIN
IN
MY
GEAR
BAG
IT
IS
ONE
OF
SEVENTY
COINS
I
GAVE
TO
THE
TEAM
I
LED
AT
YOYODYNE
A
COMPANY
I
STARTED
ATTACHED
TO
THE
COIN
IS
A
LITTLE
TAG
THAT
CELEBRATES
OUR
GROUP
AND
OUR
OVER
THE
TOP
UNDERDOG
BRAVERY
LEADERSHIP
ALMOST
ALWAYS
INVOLVES
THINKING
AND
ACTING
LIKE
THE
UNDERDOG
THAT
BECAUSE
LEADERS
WORK
TO
CHANGE
THINGS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
WINNING
RARELY
DO
WHAT
WE
DID
WAS
AND
WHAT
YOU
DO
IS
COURAGEOUS
IT
REQUIRES
BRAVERY
MANAGING
DOESN
T
AND
FOLLOWING
THE
RULES
TO
MAKE
A
LIVING
DOESN
T
IT
MIGHT
BE
HARD
WORK
BUT
IT
FEELS
SAFE
CHANGING
THINGS
PUSHING
THE
ENVELOPE
AND
CREATING
A
FUTURE
THAT
DOESN
T
EXIST
YET
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
YOU
RE
CRITICIZED
BY
EVERYONE
ELSE
REQUIRES
BRAVERY
AND
OVER
THE
TOP
THAT
EASY
ORDINARY
THINKING
AND
ORDINARY
EFFORT
ARE
ALMOST
NEVER
ENOUGH
TO
GENERATE
LEADERSHIP
THAT
BECAUSE
OUR
INCLINATION
IS
TO
DO
BARELY
ENOUGH
IT
TAKES
SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY
A
CALL
TO
ACTION
THAT
IS
IRRESISTIBLE
AND
A
CAUSE
WORTH
FIGHTING
FOR
TO
MAKE
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
JOIN
IN
IF
YOU
RE
NOT
OVER
THE
TOP
YOU
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
HAVE
ANY
CHANCE
AT
ALL
OF
MAKING
THINGS
HAPPEN
THE
EASIEST
THING
THE
EASIEST
THING
IS
TO
REACT
THE
SECOND
EASIEST
THING
IS
TO
RESPOND
BUT
THE
HARDEST
THING
IS
TO
INITIATE
REACTING
AS
ZIG
ZIGLAR
HAS
SAID
IS
WHAT
YOUR
BODY
DOES
WHEN
YOU
TAKE
THE
WRONG
KIND
OF
MEDICINE
REACTING
IS
WHAT
POLITICIANS
DO
ALL
THE
TIME
REACTING
IS
INTUITIVE
AND
INSTINCTIVE
AND
USUALLY
DANGEROUS
MANAGERS
REACT
RESPONDING
IS
A
MUCH
BETTER
ALTERNATIVE
YOU
RESPOND
TO
EXTERNAL
STIMULI
WITH
THOUGHTFUL
ACTION
ORGANIZATIONS
RESPOND
TO
COMPETITIVE
THREATS
INDIVIDUALS
RESPOND
TO
COLLEAGUES
OR
TO
OPPORTUNITIES
RESPONSE
IS
ALWAYS
BETTER
THAN
REACTION
BUT
BOTH
PALE
IN
COMPARISON
TO
INITIATIVE
INITIATING
IS
REALLY
AND
TRULY
DIFFICULT
AND
THAT
WHAT
LEADERS
DO
THEY
SEE
SOMETHING
OTHERS
ARE
IGNORING
AND
THEY
JUMP
ON
IT
THEY
CAUSE
THE
EVENTS
THAT
OTHERS
HAVE
TO
REACT
TO
THEY
MAKE
CHANGE
TAKE
THE
FOLLOW
THE
MERITS
OF
LEADERSHIP
ARE
SO
INGRAINED
THAT
IT
NATURAL
TO
SAY
I
LL
TAKE
THE
LEAD
SOMETIMES
THOUGH
IT
MAY
MAKE
MORE
SENSE
TO
TAKE
THE
FOLLOW
LEADING
WHEN
YOU
DON
T
KNOW
WHERE
TO
GO
WHEN
YOU
DON
T
HAVE
THE
COMMITMENT
OR
THE
PASSION
OR
WORST
OF
ALL
WHEN
YOU
CAN
T
OVERCOME
YOUR
FEAR
THAT
SORT
OF
LEADING
IS
WORSE
THAN
NONE
AT
ALL
IT
TAKES
GUTS
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
PERHAPS
THIS
TIME
RIGHT
NOW
YOU
CAN
T
LEAD
SO
GET
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
AND
TAKE
THE
FOLLOW
INSTEAD
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THINGS
THAT
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
AND
THINGS
YOU
DO
IN
THE
OLD
MODEL
THINGS
HAPPENED
TO
YOU
AT
WORK
FACTORIES
OPENED
PEOPLE
WERE
HIRED
BOSSES
GAVE
INSTRUCTIONS
YOU
GOT
TRANSFERRED
THERE
WERE
LAYOFFS
YOU
GOT
PROMOTED
FACTORIES
CLOSED
LEADERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
DON
T
HAVE
THINGS
HAPPEN
TO
THEM
THEY
DO
THINGS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
MORTGAGE
CRISIS
I
SPENT
SOME
TIME
WITH
A
FEW
THOUSAND
REALTORS
AT
THEIR
ANNUAL
CONVENTION
WHAT
I
DISCOVERED
MIGHT
SURPRISE
YOU
THE
GROUP
WAS
COMPLETELY
SPLIT
SOME
OF
THE
REALTORS
SAW
WHAT
THE
MEDIA
BEAR
STEARNS
THE
BANKS
AND
THE
PUBLIC
WERE
DOING
TO
THEM
AND
TO
THEIR
HARD
WON
CAREERS
THEY
WERE
ANGRY
EVEN
BITTER
ABOUT
THE
END
OF
A
LONG
RUN
OF
INCREASING
HOUSING
PRICES
AND
THEY
WERE
SCARED
ABOUT
THEIR
FUTURES
THESE
REALTORS
DIDN
T
KNOW
HOW
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
COPE
WITH
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
THEY
WANTED
TO
MANAGE
THEIR
CAREERS
BUT
CHANGE
WAS
MAKING
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
OTHER
REALTORS
WERE
PALPABLY
EXCITED
THEY
WERE
EAGER
TO
GET
TO
WORK
THEY
SAW
THE
CHANGE
IN
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
AS
AN
OPPORTUNITY
A
CHANCE
FOR
THEM
TO
DRAMATICALLY
INCREASE
THEIR
BUSINESS
THEY
KNEW
THAT
THE
CURRENT
PROBLEMS
WOULDN
T
LAST
FOREVER
AND
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
WOULD
WIPE
OUT
THE
OPPORTUNITY
SEEKERS
LEAVING
THE
PROFESSIONALS
STANDING
SOME
OR
PERCENT
OF
THE
REALTORS
WERE
GOING
TO
QUIT
AND
THE
LEADERS
THE
ONES
WHO
WERE
GOING
TO
STAY
REALIZED
THAT
THIS
CHANGE
WAS
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
THE
SAME
WAY
SOLDIERS
REALIZE
THAT
IT
WAR
THAT
MAKES
GENERALS
THESE
BROKERS
WERE
READY
AND
MOTIVATED
TO
USE
CHANGE
AS
A
CHANCE
TO
REALLY
WREAK
SOME
HAVOC
ON
THE
STATUS
QUO
PERMEABILITY
PERHAPS
YOU
WORK
FOR
BOEING
OR
MONSANTO
OR
SOME
OTHER
CORPORATE
BEHEMOTH
IT
MORE
LIKELY
THOUGH
THAT
YOU
WORK
FOR
A
SMALL
ORGANIZATION
PERHAPS
AS
SMALL
AS
JUST
A
FEW
PEOPLE
EITHER
WAY
IT
WORTH
TAKING
A
MINUTE
TO
REMIND
YOURSELF
OF
HOW
IT
USED
TO
BE
IT
USED
TO
BE
THAT
EXECUTIVES
HAD
SECRETARIES
WHO
HAD
SECRETARIES
THAT
YOU
SENT
A
MEMO
TO
YOUR
BOSS
AND
ONLY
YOUR
BOSS
AND
THEN
WAITED
A
WEEK
OR
A
MONTH
FOR
A
RESPONSE
THAT
YOU
DIDN
T
SHARE
A
NEW
IDEA
WITH
A
COWORKER
THE
DIRECTION

WAS
PREFERABLY
DOWN
OR
SOMETIMES
UP

THE
AGE
OF
HERETICS
TELLS
STORIES
ONE
AFTER
ANOTHER
OF
CORPORATE
HERETICS
WHO
ENDED
UP
DEMOTED
FIRED
DISGRACED
AND
UNHAPPY
CORPORATIONS
MIGHT
AS
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
RUN
BY
JOSEPH
STALIN
THEY
HAD
UNALTERABLE
FIVE
YEAR
PLANS
SHARPLY
CONTROLLED
CHANNELS
OF
COMMUNICATION
AND
A
ROYAL
COURT
SURROUNDING
THE
MONARCH
ORGANIZATIONS
USED
TO
BE
MANAGED
WITH
NO
PLACE
FOR
LEADERS
NO
USE
FOR
HERETICS
GROWING
UP
I
USED
TO
VISIT
MY
DAD
OFFICE
I
STILL
REMEMBER
THE
SIGN
NEXT
TO
THE
CORPORATE
OFFICE
MEN
ROOM
NO
PLANT
WORKERS
NOT
ONLY
WEREN
T
THE
SKILLED
AND
SMART
LATHE
OPERATORS
ALLOWED
TO
USE
THE
MEN
ROOM
IN
THE
ADJOINING
OFFICE
BUT
THEY
WEREN
T
OFTEN
INVITED
TO
SHARE
WHAT
THEY
KNEW
WITH
THEIR
BOSSES
EITHER
THE
SYSTEM
WAS
RIGID
KODAK
FOR
EXAMPLE
LITERALLY
KEPT
ITS
WORKERS
IN
THE
DARK
TOILING
IN
A
PITCH
BLACK
FACTORY
AS
THEY
MADE
FILM
WHILE
THE
PROCESS
REQUIRED
DARKNESS
IT
DIDN
T
REQUIRE
RIGID
MANAGEMENT
OR
THE
HOARDING
OF
INFORMATION
AND
POWER
THAT
JUST
CAME
WITH
THE
TERRITORY
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THAT
IT
DOESN
T
RESPOND
WELL
TO
A
CHANGING
WORLD
AND
IT
CERTAINLY
DOESN
T
DO
WELL
WHEN
INFORMATION
COMES
IN
FROM
MANY
DIRECTIONS
FROM
MANY
SOURCES
WHEN
EVERYONE
YOU
WORKED
WITH
READ
THE
HARVARD
BUSINESS
REVIEW
AND
THE
SAME
STUDY
FROM
MCKINSEY
IT
WAS
EASY
TOP
MANAGEMENT
NOW
WANTS
LEADERS
IT
WANTS
HERETICS
WHO
WILL
CREATE
CHANGE
BEFORE
CHANGE
HAPPENS
TO
THEM
TOP
MANAGEMENT
UNDERSTANDS
THAT
THEY
NEED
FOLLOWERS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
ENGAGE
THE
TRIBE
WITH
CHANGE
AND
REMARKABLE
INITIATIVE
BUT
THE
RANK
AND
FILE
HESITATES
WE
HESITATE
BECAUSE
WE
VE
SEEN
WHAT
HAPPENED
BEFORE
WE
RE
AFRAID
OF
FAILURE
OF
CRITICISM
OF
MAKING
A
MISTAKE
AND
OF
GETTING
CAUGHT
WE
WORRY
THAT
WE
LL
LOSE
OUR
JOBS
IF
WE
STOP
MANAGING
AND
START
LEADING
THE
AGE
OF
LEVERAGE
CHANGES
THIS
BUT
THE
FEAR
REMAINS
THE
OLD
STORIES
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
JOE
OR
BOB
OR
SUE
THIRTY
YEARS
AGO
ARE
TOLD
OVER
AND
OVER
WE
USE
THEM
TO
STOKE
OUR
FEAR
TO
RATIONALIZE
OUR
DESIRE
TO
HIDE
NEWS
FLASH
THE
HERETICS
NOT
ONLY
LIVE
TO
TELL
ABOUT
IT
NOW
THEY
ACTUALLY
THRIVE
JERRY
SHERESHEWSKY
WAS
A
HERETIC
AT
YOUNG
RUBICAM
WHERE
HIS
BRASH
NATURE
DIDN
T
SIT
WELL
WITH
THE
BUTTONED
DOWN
CULTURE
OF
A
ADVERTISING
AGENCY
NO
WORRIES
JERRY
WENT
ON
TO
MAKE
A
NAME
FOR
HIMSELF
AT
BMG
AND
THEN
WITH
ME
AT
YOYODYNE
THEN
AT
YAHOO
AND
NOW
AT
A
WEB
START
UP
CALLED
GRANDPARENTS
COM
QUITE
A
CAREER
IF
HE
HAD
KEPT
HIS
MOUTH
SHUT
HE
D
STILL
BE
MARKETING
COFFEEMAKERS
LEADERS
GO
FIRST
EVERYONE
WILL
THINK
IT
STUPID
EVERYONE
SAYS
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
GUESS
WHAT
EVERYONE
WORKS
IN
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
AND
EVERYONE
IS
WRONG
THE
STATUS
QUO
IS
PERSISTENT
AND
RESISTANT
IT
EXISTS
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
WANTS
IT
TO
EVERYONE
BELIEVES
THAT
WHAT
THEY
VE
GOT
IS
PROBABLY
BETTER
THAN
THE
RISK
AND
FEAR
THAT
COME
WITH
CHANGE
EVERYONE
IN
THE
DEVELOPING
WORLD
BELIEVES
THAT
THINGS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
THE
WAY
THEY
WERE
SO
WHEN
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AND
TECHNOLOGY
SHOW
UP
IN
A
VILLAGE
IN
KENYA
EVERYONE
RESISTS
EVERYONE
AT
A
FADING
RECORD
COMPANY
BELIEVES
THAT
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
MAKE
A
LIVING
IS
TO
OWN
THE
INCOME
STREAM
FROM
SELLING
CDS
OR
DIGITAL
DOWNLOADS
SO
WHEN
NEW
BUSINESS
MODELS
PRESENT
THEMSELVES
EVERYONE
IGNORES
THEM
OR
WORSE
SUES
EVERYONE
AT
MICROSOFT
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
COMPANY
WAS
INVINCIBLE
AND
THAT
THE
PIDDLING
SEARCH
ENGINES
AND
INTERNET
COMPANIES
IN
THE
VALLEY
COULDN
T
POSSIBLY
REPRESENT
A
THREAT
STEVE
BALLMER
CEO
OF
MICROSOFT
SAID
GOOGLE
NOT
A
REAL
COMPANY
IT
A
HOUSE
OF

HE
ALSO
SAID
THERE
CAN
T
BE
ANY
MORE
DEEP
TECHNOLOGY
IN
FACEBOOK
THAN
WHAT
DOZENS
OF
PEOPLE
COULD
WRITE
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
THAT
FOR
SURE
OVER
AND
OVER
EVERYONE
IS
WRONG
UNLESS
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
INNOVATION
CAN
CHANGE
THINGS
THAT
HERETICS
CAN
BREAK
THE
RULES
AND
THAT
REMARKABLE
PRODUCTS
AND
SERVICES
SPREAD
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THEN
YOU
RE
NOT
EVERYONE
THEN
YOU
RE
RIGHT
WATCHING
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
DIE
IT
NOT
AS
IF
THEY
DIDN
T
SEE
IT
COMING
IT
TOOK
ALMOST
A
DECADE
FOR
THIS
THRIVING
HYPERPROFITABLE
INDUSTRY
TO
CAVE
IN
ON
ITSELF
THE
REASONS
ARE
TRULY
SIMPLE
MUSIC
INDUSTRY
EXECUTIVES
DIDN
T
HAVE
THE
HERETIC
THEY
NEEDED
NO
ONE
STOOD
UP
AND
MADE
CHANGE
HAPPEN
THEY
FORGOT
TO
EMBRACE
THEIR
TRIBE
TAKING
A
LOOK
AT
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
IS
A
USEFUL
EDUCATION
FOR
ANY
HERETIC
IT
DEMONSTRATES
HOW
EXCEEDINGLY
INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE
IN
A
FAIRLY
NEW
INDUSTRY
WILLFULLY
IGNORED
THE
WORLD
AROUND
THEM
AND
HID
THOSE
LESSONS
APPLY
TO
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
INDUSTRY
YOU
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
FIRST
RULE
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
FAILED
TO
UNDERSTAND
IS
THAT
AT
LEAST
AT
FIRST
THE
NEW
THING
IS
RARELY
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
OLD
THING
WAS
IF
YOU
NEED
THE
ALTERNATIVE
TO
BE
BETTER
THAN
THE
STATUS
QUO
FROM
THE
VERY
START
YOU
LL
NEVER
BEGIN
SOON
ENOUGH
THE
NEW
THING
WILL
BE
BETTER
THAN
THE
OLD
THING
BUT
IF
YOU
WAIT
UNTIL
THEN
IT
GOING
TO
BE
TOO
LATE
FEEL
FREE
TO
WAX
NOSTALGIC
ABOUT
THE
OLD
THING
BUT
DON
T
FOOL
YOURSELF
INTO
BELIEVING
THAT
IT
GOING
TO
BE
HERE
FOREVER
IT
WON
T
THE
SECOND
RULE
THEY
MISSED
IS
THAT
PAST
PERFORMANCE
IS
NO
GUARANTEE
OF
FUTURE
SUCCESS
EVERY
SINGLE
INDUSTRY
CHANGES
AND
EVENTUALLY
FADES
WHILE
YOU
MAY
HAVE
MADE
MONEY
DOING
SOMETHING
A
CERTAIN
WAY
YESTERDAY
THERE
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
YOU
LL
SUCCEED
AT
IT
TOMORROW
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
HAD
A
SPECTACULAR
RUN
ALONGSIDE
THE
BABY
BOOMERS
STARTING
WITH
THE
BEATLES
AND
DYLAN
MUSIC
INDUSTRY
EXECUTIVES

OF

WITH
THE
BIRTH
OF

THE
INVENTION
OF
THE

AND
CHANGING
SOCIAL
MORES
MEANT
A
LONG
LONG

AS
A

THE

THEY

TOURING
INDUSTRY
EXTRAORDINARILY
HIGH

MTV
AND
MORE
IT
WAS
A
WELL
GREASED
SYSTEM
BUT
THE
KEY
QUESTION
IS
WHY
DID
IT
DESERVE
TO
LAST
FOREVER
IT
DIDN
T
YOURS
DOESN
T
EITHER
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
WAS
BUILT
AROUND
FIVE
PILLARS
FREE
RADIO
PROMOTION
A
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
COMPETING
MUSIC
LABELS
THE
HIGH
COST
OF
PRODUCTION
REQUIRING
MUSICIANS
TO
GET
FINANCING
FROM

THE
TOP
HITS
BASED

OF
THE
BABY
BOOMER
GENERATION
A
HIGH

NONREPRODUCIBLE
MEDIUM
THE

NOTICE
THAT
NONE
OF
THESE
FIVE
PILLARS
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
TRIBES
OR
LEADERSHIP
ONE
BY
ONE
EACH
OF
THESE
FIVE
PILLARS
HAS
CRUMBLED
OVER
THE
PAST
FIVE
YEARS
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
WHILE
THERE
IS
STILL
PLENTY
OF
MUSIC
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
IS
IN
TROUBLE
THE
INNOVATION
USE
DIGITAL
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
INTERNET
LIKE
RADIO
BUT
DO
IT
BETTER
BE
IN
THE
SERVICES
SOUVENIR
BUSINESS
INSTEAD
OF
SUING
CUSTOMERS
AND
YEARNING
FOR
THE
OLD
DAYS
FIND
THOUSANDS
OF
TRIBES
FOR
THOUSANDS
OF
MUSICIANS
AND
LEAD
THEM
WHERE
THEY
WANT
TO
GO
THE
BEST
TIME
TO
CHANGE
YOUR
BUSINESS
MODEL
IS
WHILE
YOU
STILL
HAVE
MOMENTUM
IT
NOT
SO
EASY
FOR
AN
UNKNOWN
ARTIST
TO
START
FROM
SCRATCH
AND
BUILD
A
CAREER
SELF
PUBLISHING
NOT
SO
EASY
FOR
HER
TO
FIND
FANS
ONE
AT
A
TIME
AND
BUILD
AN
AUDIENCE
VERY
VERY
EASY
FOR
A
RECORD
LABEL
OR
A
TOP
ARTIST
TO
DO
SO
SO
THE
TIME
TO
JUMP
WAS
YESTERDAY
TOO
LATE
OKAY
HOW
ABOUT
TODAY
THE
SOONER
YOU
DO
IT
THE
MORE
ASSETS
AND
MOMENTUM
YOU
HAVE
TO
PUT
TO
WORK
DON
T
PANIC
WHEN
THE
NEW
BUSINESS
MODEL
ISN
T
AS
CLEAN
AS
THE
OLD
ONE
IT
NOT
EASY
TO
GIVE
UP
THE
IDEA
OF
MANUFACTURING
CDS
WITH
A
PERCENT
GROSS
MARGIN
AND
SWITCH
TO
A
BLENDED
MODEL
OF
CONCERTS
AND
SOUVENIRS
OF
COMMUNITIES
AND
GREETING
CARDS
AND
SPECIAL
EVENTS
AND
WHAT
FEELS
LIKE
GIMMICKS
GET
OVER
IT
IT
THE
ONLY
OPTION
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
STAY
IN
THIS
BUSINESS
YOU
RE
NOT
GOING
TO
SELL
A
LOT
OF
CDS
IN
FIVE
YEARS
ARE
YOU
IF
THERE
A
BUSINESS
HERE
THE
FIRST
FEW
IN
WILL
FIND
IT
THE
REST
WILL
LOSE
EVERYTHING
THE
INDUSTRY
WILLFULLY
FAILED
TO
READ
THE
WRITING
ON
THE
WALL
INDUSTRIES
DON
T
DIE
BY
SURPRISE
IT
NOT
AS
IF
YOU
DIDN
T
KNOW
IT
WAS
COMING
IT
NOT
AS
IF
YOU
DIDN
T
KNOW
WHOM
TO
CALL
OR
HIRE
WHAT
WAS
MISSING
WAS
LEADERSHIP
AN
INDIVIDUAL
A
HERETIC
READY
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
FUTURE
AND
BUILD
THE
COALITIONS
NECESSARY
TO
GET
THERE
THIS
ISN
T
ABOUT
HAVING
A
GREAT
IDEA
IT
ALMOST
NEVER
IS
THE
GREAT
IDEAS
ARE
OUT
THERE
FOR
FREE
ON
YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD
BLOG
NOPE
THIS
IS
ABOUT
TAKING
INITIATIVE
AND
MAKING
THINGS
HAPPEN
THE
LAST
PERSON
TO
LEAVE
THE
CURRENT
RECORD
BUSINESS
WON
T
BE
THE
SMARTEST
AND
HE
WON
T
BE
THE
MOST
SUCCESSFUL
EITHER
GETTING
OUT
FIRST
AND
STAKING
OUT
THE
NEW
TERRITORY
ALMOST
ALWAYS
PAYS
OFF
I
KNOW
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
BUT
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
ARE
YET
TO
HAPPEN
EVEN
FOR
THE
MUSIC
BUSINESS
THE
THING
IS
THE
GUYS
WHO
RAN
IT
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
WON
T
BE
AROUND
WHEN
IT
REGROUPS
BECAUSE
THEY
WON
T
BE
WELCOME
SHEEPWALKING
I
DEFINE
SHEEPWALKING
AS
THE
OUTCOME
OF
HIRING
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
RAISED
TO
BE
OBEDIENT
AND
GIVING
THEM
BRAIN
DEAD
JOBS
AND
ENOUGH
FEAR
TO
KEEP
THEM
IN
LINE
YOU
VE
PROBABLY
ENCOUNTERED
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
SHEEPWALKING
THE
TSA
SCREENER
WHO
FORCES
A
MOM
TO
DRINK
FROM
A
BOTTLE
OF
BREAST
MILK
BECAUSE
ANY
OTHER
ACTION
IS
NOT
IN
THE
MANUAL
A
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
REPRESENTATIVE
WHO
WILL
HAPPILY
READ
ALOUD
A
COMPANY
POLICY
SIX
OR
SEVEN
TIMES
BUT
NEVER
STOP
TO
CONSIDER
WHAT
THE
POLICY
MEANS
A
MARKETING
EXECUTIVE
WHO
BUYS
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
WORTH
OF
TV
TIME
EVEN
THOUGH
SHE
KNOWS
IT
NOT
WORKING
SHE
DOES
IT
BECAUSE
HER
BOSS
TOLD
HER
TO
IT
IRONIC
BUT
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
IN
OUR
AGE
OF
INCREASED
RELIANCE
ON
NEW
IDEAS
RAPID
CHANGE
AND
INNOVATION
SHEEPWALKING
IS
ACTUALLY
ON
THE
RISE
THAT
BECAUSE
WE
CAN
NO
LONGER
RELY
ON
MACHINES
TO
DO
THE
BRAIN
DEAD
STUFF
WE
VE
MECHANIZED
WHAT
WE
COULD
MECHANIZE
WHAT
LEFT
IS
TO
COST
REDUCE
THE
MANUAL
LABOR
THAT
MUST
BE
DONE
BY
A
HUMAN
SO
WE
WRITE
MANUALS
AND
RACE
TO
THE
BOTTOM
IN
OUR
SEARCH
FOR
THE
CHEAPEST
POSSIBLE
LABOR
AND
IT
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
WHEN
WE
GO
TO
HIRE
THAT
LABOR
WE
SEARCH
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
TRAINED
TO
BE
SHEEPLIKE
TRAINING
A
STUDENT
TO
BE
A
SHEEP
IS
A
LOT
EASIER
THAN
THE
ALTERNATIVE
TEACHING
TO
THE
TEST
ENSURING
COMPLIANT
BEHAVIOR
AND
USING
FEAR
AS
A
MOTIVATOR
ARE
THE
EASIEST
AND
FASTEST
WAYS
TO
GET
A
KID
THROUGH
SCHOOL
SO
WHY
DOES
IT
SURPRISE
US
THAT
WE
GRADUATE
SO
MANY
SHEEP
AND
GRADUATE
SCHOOL
BECAUSE
THE
STAKES
ARE
HIGHER
OPPORTUNITY
COST
TUITION
AND
THE
JOB
MARKET
STUDENTS
FALL
BACK
ON
WHAT
THEY
VE
BEEN
TAUGHT
TO
BE
SHEEP
WELL
EDUCATED
SHEEP
OF
COURSE
BUT
COMPLIANT
NONETHELESS
AND
MANY
ORGANIZATIONS
GO
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
TO
HIRE
PEOPLE
WHO
COLOR
INSIDE
THE
LINES
WHO
DEMONSTRATE
CONSISTENCY
AND
COMPLIANCE
AND
THEN
THESE
ORGANIZATIONS
GIVE
THESE
PEOPLE
JOBS
WHERE
THEY
ARE
MANAGED
VIA
FEAR
WHICH
LEADS
TO
SHEEPWALKING
I
MIGHT
GET
FIRED
THE
FAULT
DOESN
T
LIE
WITH
THE
EMPLOYEE
AT
LEAST
NOT
AT
FIRST
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
PAIN
IS
OFTEN
BORNE
BY
BOTH
THE
EMPLOYEE
AND
THE
CUSTOMER
IS
IT
LESS
EFFICIENT
TO
PURSUE
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
YOU
BUILD
AN
ORGANIZATION
THAT
FLAT
AND
OPEN
AND
TREATS
EMPLOYEES
WITH
RESPECT
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
YOU
EXPECT
A
LOT
AND
TRUST
THE
PEOPLE
YOU
WORK
WITH
AT
FIRST
IT
SEEMS
CRAZY
THERE
TOO
MUCH
OVERHEAD
TOO
LITTLE
PREDICTABILITY
AND
WAY
TOO
MUCH
NOISE
THIS
ISN
T
THE
TOP
DOWN
MODEL
OF
THE
FACTORY
OR
THE
KING
AND
HIS
COURT
IT
CHAOS
IT
EASY
TO
REJECT
OUT
OF
HAND
THEN
OVER
AND
OVER
WE
SEE
SOMETHING
HAPPEN
WHEN
YOU
HIRE
AMAZING
PEOPLE
AND
GIVE
THEM
FREEDOM
THEY
DO
AMAZING
STUFF
AND
THE
SHEEPWALKERS
AND
THEIR
BOSSES
WATCH
AND
SHAKE
THEIR
HEADS
CERTAIN
THAT
THIS
IS
AN
EXCEPTION
AND
THAT
IT
IS
WAY
TOO
RISKY
FOR
THEIR
INDUSTRY
OR
THEIR
CUSTOMER
BASE
I
WAS
AT
A
GOOGLE
CONFERENCE
LAST
MONTH
AND
I
SPENT
SOME
TIME
IN
A
ROOM
FILLED
WITH
PRETTY
NEWLY
MINTED
GOOGLE
SALES
REPS
I
TALKED
TO
A
FEW
OF
THEM
FOR
A
WHILE
ABOUT
THE
STATE
OF
THE
INDUSTRY
AND
IT
BROKE
MY
HEART
TO
DISCOVER
THAT
THEY
WERE
SHEEPWALKING
CONSIDER
THE
RECEPTIONIST
AT
A
PUBLISHING
COMPANY
I
VISITED
A
WEEK
LATER
THERE
SHE
WAS
DOING
NOTHING
SITTING
AT
A
DESK
MINDING
HER
OWN
BUSINESS
BORED
OUT
OF
HER
SKULL
SHE
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
THE
FRONT
OFFICE
IS
VERY
SLOW
AND
THAT
SHE
JUST
SITS
THERE
READING
ROMANCE
NOVELS
AND
WAITING
AND
SHE
BEEN
DOING
IT
FOR
TWO
YEARS
OR
CONSIDER
THE
MBA
STUDENT
I
MET
YESTERDAY
WHO
IS
TAKING
A
JOB
AT
A
MAJOR
PACKAGED
GOODS
COMPANY
BECAUSE
THEY
OFFERED
HER
A
GREAT
SALARY
AND
PROMISED
HER
A
WELL
KNOWN
BRAND
SHE
GOING
TO
STAY
FOR
JUST
TEN
YEARS
THEN
HAVE
A
BABY
AND
LEAVE
AND
START
MY
OWN
GIG
SHE
LL
GET
REALLY
GOOD
AT
RUNNING
COUPONS
IN
THE
SUNDAY
PAPER
BUT
NOT
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
AT
SOLVING
NEW
PROBLEMS
WHAT
A
WASTE
STEP
ONE
IS
TO
GIVE
THE
PROBLEM
A
NAME
SHEEPWALKING
DONE
STEP
TWO
IS
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
SEE
YOURSELF
IN
THIS
MIRROR
TO
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
STOP
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
CLAIM
THE
CAREER
YOU
DESERVE
MERELY
BY
REFUSING
TO
WALK
DOWN
THE
SAME
PATH
AS
EVERYONE
ELSE
JUST
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
ELSE
IS
ALREADY
DOING
IT
THE
BIGGEST
STEP
THOUGH
COMES
FROM
ANYONE
WHO
TEACHES
OR
HIRES
AND
THAT
TO
EMBRACE
NONSHEEP
BEHAVIOR
TO
REWARD
IT
AND
CHERISH
IT
AS
WE
VE
SEEN
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYWHERE
THERE
BEEN
GROWTH
LATELY
IS
WHERE
THE
GOOD
STUFF
HAPPENS
I
JUST
REREAD
THESE
PARAGRAPHS
AND
I
M
BETTING
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
THINK
I
M
BEING
WAY
TOO
HARSH
THAT
DEPENDS
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
INNATE
POTENTIAL
THAT
WORK
IS
TOO
TIME
CONSUMING
TO
BE
DULL
AND
THAT
ORGANIZATIONS
NEED
PASSION
FROM
EMPLOYEES
AND
FROM
CUSTOMERS
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
GROW
INTO
TRIBES
AND
MOVEMENTS
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
MARKETERS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THEY
TOUCH
IS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
INVEST
IN
I
THINK
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
ALL
THAT
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
YOURSELF
AND
YOUR
COWORKERS
THEN
THIS
ISN
T
NEARLY
HARSH
ENOUGH
WE
NEED
TO
HURRY
WE
NEED
TO
WAKE
UP
HOW
WAS
YOUR
DAY
IT
FOUR
A
M
AND
I
CAN
T
SLEEP
SO
I
M
SITTING
IN
THE
LOBBY
OF
A
HOTEL
IN
JAMAICA
CHECKING
MY
E
MAIL
A
COUPLE
WALKS
BY
OBVIOUSLY
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
BED
HAVING
PUSHED
THE
IDEA
OF
VACATION
A
LITTLE
TOO
HARD
THE
WOMAN
LOOKS
OVER
TO
ME
AND
IN
A
HARSH
WHISPER
A
LITTLE
QUIETER
THAN
A
YELL
SAYS
TO
HER
FRIEND
ISN
T
THAT
SAD
THAT
GUY
COMES
HERE
ON
VACATION
AND
HE
STUCK
CHECKING
HIS

HIS

WEEKS
OFF
I
THINK
THE
REAL
QUESTION
THE
ONE
THEY
PROBABLY
WOULDN
T
WANT
TO
ANSWER
WAS
ISN
T
IT
SAD
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
JOB
WHERE
WE
SPEND
TWO
WEEKS
AVOIDING
THE
STUFF
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
FIFTY
WEEKS
A
YEAR
IT
TOOK
ME
A
LONG
TIME
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
I
WAS
SO
HAPPY
TO
BE
CHECKING
MY
E
MAIL
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
NIGHT
IT
HAD
TO
DO
WITH
PASSION
OTHER
THAN
SLEEPING
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
I
D
RATHER
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
IN
THAT
MOMENT
BECAUSE
I
M
LUCKY
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
A
JOB
WHERE
I
GET
TO
MAKE
CHANGE
HAPPEN
EVEN
THOUGH
I
DON
T
HAVE
MANY
PEOPLE
WORKING
FOR
ME
I
M
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
LEADING
PEOPLE
TAKING
THEM
SOMEWHERE
WE
WANT
TO
GO
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
JOBS
FOR
NOW
WHERE
THEY
FIGHT
CHANGE
WHERE
THEY
WORK
OVERTIME
TO
DEFEND
THE
STATUS
QUO
IT
EXHAUSTING
MAINTAINING
A
SYSTEM
IN
THE
FACE
OF
CHANGE
WILL
GRIND
YOU
DOWN
THINK
FOR
A
SECOND
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
YOU
KNOW
WHO
ARE
ENGAGED
SATISFIED
EAGER
TO
GET
TO
WORK
MOST
OF
THEM
I
LL
BET
MAKE
CHANGE
THEY
CHALLENGE
THE
STATUS
QUO
AND
PUSH
SOMETHING
FORWARD
SOMETHING
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
THEY
LEAD
LIFE
TOO
SHORT
IS
REPEATED
OFTEN
ENOUGH
TO
BE
A
CLICHÉ
BUT
THIS
TIME
IT
TRUE
YOU
DON
T
HAVE
ENOUGH
TIME
TO
BE
BOTH
UNHAPPY
AND
MEDIOCRE
IT
NOT
JUST
POINTLESS
IT
PAINFUL
INSTEAD
OF
WONDERING
WHEN
YOUR
NEXT
VACATION
IS
MAYBE
YOU
OUGHT
TO
SET
UP
A
LIFE
YOU
DON
T
NEED
TO
ESCAPE
FROM
THE
AMAZING
THING
IS
THAT
NOT
ONLY
IS
THIS
SORT
OF
LIFE
EASIER
TO
SET
UP
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
BUT
IT
ALSO
MORE
LIKELY
TO
MAKE
YOU
SUCCESSFUL
AND
HAPPY
SO
HOW
WAS
YOUR
DAY
THE
THERMOMETER
AND
THE
THERMOSTAT
A
THERMOSTAT
IS
FAR
MORE
VALUABLE
THAN
A
THERMOMETER
THE
THERMOMETER
REVEALS
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
BROKEN
THE
THERMOMETER
IS
AN
INDICATOR
OUR
CANARY
IN
THE
COAL
MINE
THERMOMETERS
TELL
US
WHEN
WE
RE
SPENDING
TOO
MUCH
OR
GAINING

SHARE
OR
NOT
ANSWERING
THE

QUICKLY
ENOUGH
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
FILLED
WITH
HUMAN
THERMOMETERS
THEY
CAN
CRITICIZE
OR
POINT
OUT
OR
JUST
WHINE
THE
THERMOSTAT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MANAGES
TO
CHANGE
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IN

WITH
THE
OUTSIDE

EVERY
ORGANIZATION
NEEDS
AT

ONE
THERMOSTAT
THESE
ARE
LEADERS
WHO
CAN
CREATE
CHANGE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
AND
DO
IT
CONSISTENTLY
OVER

YOUR
MICROMOVEMENT
THIS
IS
THE
HEART
OF
THE
MATTER
EVERY

CARES
FOR
AND

A

A

LIKE
THE
FREE

MOVEMENT
AT

OR
THE
DEMOCRACY
MOVEMENT
IN

OR
THE

IN

THE

WITH

ROASTED

IN
BROOKLYN
OR
THE

OF

OBSESSED
WITH

TODAY
YOU
CAN
HAVE
A
NARROW

A

A

YOUR

BY
TEN
OR
TWENTY
OR
A

PEOPLE
PEOPLE
IN
YOUR

AND

OFTEN
IT

THE

THE

THAT
WHAT

DOES

TAKE
CONNECTED

WHAT

AND
PEOPLE
WHO
CARE
ARE
DISCOVERING
IS
THAT
THEY
CAN
IGNITE
A
MICROMOVEMENT
AND
THEN
BE
PROPELLED
BY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CHOOSE

IT
THE

IT
DOESN

HAVE
TO
BE

BUT
IT
A
MANTRA
AND
A
MOTTO
AND
A
WAY
OF

IT

WHO

ALMOST
AS

AS

DOWN
IS
NEVER

TO
A

AS
BUILDING
YOUR

UP
THAT
BUILDING
DOWN
THE

I
THINK
IT
IS
A
BOAT

BUT
PERHAPS
IT
A
POLITICAL
PARTY
OR
EVEN
A
CORPORATE
HEADQUARTERS
IT
MIGHT
EVEN
BE
A
FRANCHISE
BUSINESS
OR
A
LOCAL
NONPROFIT
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THAT
THERE
A
TRIBE
WORKING
OVERTIME
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
STATUS
QUO
THE
CONGREGATION
SHOWS
UP
EVERY
WEEK
AND
DOES
THE
SAME
RITUAL
IT
DID
LAST
WEEK
GOES
THROUGH
THE
SAME
MOTIONS
AND
NOTHING
CHANGES
IN
FACT
NOTHING
CHANGES
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
RITUAL
THE
TRIBE
EXISTS
APPARENTLY
TO
STAMP
OUT
CHANGE
THE
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
STAFF
SHOWS
UP
AND
FOLLOWS
THE
HANDBOOK
AND
TREATS
EVERY
CUSTOMER
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
AND
CAN
T
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
THEY
RE
BEING
DISRESPECTED
IN
RETURN
THE
VOLUNTEERS
GO
THROUGH
THE
MOTIONS
OF
SUPPORTING
THE
NONPROFIT
BUT
THEY
RE
THE
SAME
MOTIONS
THEY
VE
ALWAYS
GONE
THROUGH
AND
THEY
RE
GETTING
THE
SAME
RESULTS
THEY
VE
ALWAYS
GOTTEN
SOME
TRIBES
ARE
ENGAGED
IN
CHANGE
MANY
ARE
NOT
AND
IT
DOESN
T
MATTER
WHETHER
IT
A
CHURCH
OR
A

THE
SYMPTOMS
ARE
THE

THE

DEFEATED
BY
FEAR
AND
THE

QUO
CALCIFIES
LEADING
TO
THE
LONG
SLOW
DEATH
OF
THE
STALLED
ORGANIZATION
IT
SO
SAD
TO
WATCH
AND
IT
SO
COMMON
LEADERSHIP
IS
THE
ANTIDOTE
AND
IT
WORKS
IN
EVERY
BUILDING
IF
YOU
LET
IT
EVERY
TRIBE
IS
A
MEDIA
CHANNEL
TIME
MAGAZINE
IS
A
MEDIA
CHANNEL
SO
ARE
CNN
AND
YAHOO
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
TRADITIONAL

CHANNELS
IS
THAT
THEY
RE
AVAILABLE
FOR
RENT
SEND
IN
SOME
MONEY
AND
BUY
SOME
TIME
THE
TIME
GETS
YOU
EYEBALLS
OR
POSSIBLY
EVEN
ATTENTION
AND
THAT
ATTENTION
MIGHT
LEAD
TO

GOOGLE
REALIZED
THAT
EVERY

MORE
THAN
A

A

IS
A

CHANNEL
AS
WELL
AND
THEY
VE
PROFITED
BY
SELLING
THOSE
CHANNELS
ONE
CLICK
AT

TRIBES
ARE
DIFFERENT
TRIBES
ARE
THE
MOST

CHANNELS
EVER
BUT
THEY
RE
NOT
FOR

OR
FOR

TRIBES
DON
T
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
THEY
DO
WHAT
THEY

WHICH
IS
WHY
JOINING

LEADING
A

IS
SUCH
A
POWERFUL
MARKETING
INVESTMENT
HOW
TO
BE
WRONG
JOHN
ZOGBY
THE
SUCCESSFUL
POLLSTER
WAS
COMPLETELY
UTTERLY
WRONG
ABOUT
AL
GORE
IN
FLORIDA
BY
TEN
POINTS
AND
HE
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
JOHN
KERRY
AND
WRONG
ABOUT
HIS
PREDICTION
FOR
THE
NEW
HAMPSHIRE
PRIMARIES
IN
BUT
NOTICE
THAT
I
SAID
SUCCESSFUL
POLLSTER
NOT
DISGRACED
POLLSTER
IF
HE
WASN
T
WILLING
TO
BE
WRONG
HE
D
BE
UNABLE
TO
BE
RIGHT
AS
OFTEN
AS
HE
IS
ISAAC
NEWTON
WAS
TOTALLY
FANTASTICALLY
WRONG
ABOUT
ALCHEMY
THE
BRANCH
OF
SCIENCE
HE
SPENT
MOST
OF
HIS
CAREER
ON
HE
WAS
AS
WRONG
AS
A
SCIENTIST
COULD
BE
AND
YET
HE
WIDELY
REGARDED
AS
THE
MOST
SUCCESSFUL
SCIENTIST
AND
MATHEMATICIAN
EVER
STEVE
JOBS
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
APPLE
III
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
NEXT
COMPUTER
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
NEWTON
INSANELY
WRONG
YOU
KNOW
THE
REST
THE
SECRET
OF
BEING
WRONG
ISN
T
TO
AVOID
BEING
WRONG
THE
SECRET
IS
BEING
WILLING
TO
BE
WRONG
THE
SECRET
IS
REALIZING
THAT
WRONG
ISN
T
FATAL
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
MAKES
PEOPLE
AND
ORGANIZATIONS
GREAT
IS
THEIR
WILLINGNESS
TO
BE
NOT
GREAT
ALONG
THE
WAY
THE
DESIRE
TO
FAIL
ON
THE
WAY
TO
REACHING
A
BIGGER
GOAL
IS
THE
UNTOLD
SECRET
OF
SUCCESS
I
VE
BEEN
WAITING
FOR
YOU
TO
ASK
FOR
THE
SHORTCUT
THE
ERROR
FREE
FAILURE
FREE
WAY
TO
GET
PEOPLE
TO
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
MAKE
CHANGE
HAPPEN
WITHOUT
RISK
OR
FEAR
TO
MAGICALLY
ALTER
THE
STATUS
QUO
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
SELL
YOU
ON
THE
IDEAS
HERE
IF
I
COULD
JUST
GIVE
YOU
THE
ANSWER
YOU
D
BE
LEADING
A
TRIBE
RIGHT
NOW
THE
HONEST
ANSWER
IS
THERE
ISN
T
AN
EASY
WAY
IT
ISN
T
EASY
FOR
MIDDLE
MANAGERS
OR
CEOS
OR
HERETICS
THE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
THEY
APPEAR
TO
RISK
EVERYTHING
BUT
IN
FACT
THE
RISK
ISN
T
SO
BAD
THE
DOWNSIDES
ARE
PRETTY
SMALL
BECAUSE
FEW
OF
US
ARE
LIKELY
TO
GET
BURNED
AT
THE
STAKE
THE
SECRET
OF
LEADERSHIP
IS
SIMPLE
DO
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
PAINT
A
PICTURE
OF
THE
FUTURE
GO
THERE
PEOPLE
WILL
FOLLOW
THE
TIMING
OF
LEADERSHIP
IT
RARE
THAT
IT
OBVIOUS
WHEN
TO
LEAD
SURE
THERE
ARE
TIMES
WHEN
YOU
KNOW
YOU
NEED
TO
STAND
UP
TAKE
A
POSITION
SPREAD
AN
IDEA
CLEAR
OUT
AN
OBSTACLE
AND
BE
BRAVE
BUT
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
NOT
GREAT
LEADERSHIP
HAPPENS
WHEN
THE
TRIBE
LEAST
EXPECTS
IT
THE
NONOBVIOUS
MOMENTS
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
COUNT
LIKE
NOW
PERHAPS
THE
REACTIONARY
TRIBE
SO
FAR
WE
VE
BEEN
TALKING
ABOUT
TRIBES
AS
LEADERSHIP
LOVING
FAST
MOVING
PROGRESSIVE
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
THRIVE
ON
CHANGE
AND
MOST
TRIBES
ESPECIALLY
AS
THEY
GROW
ARE
JUST
THAT
BUT
SOONER
OR
LATER
TRIBES
GET
STUCK
LET
LOOK
AT
WIKIPEDIA
AGAIN
WIKIPEDIA
IS
A
NONPROFIT
THAT
IS
RUN
BY
A
CONSERVATIVE
BOARD
AND
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
DEDICATED
VOLUNTEERS
AND
MOST
OF
THEM
DON
T
WANT
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
TO
CHANGE
IN
RECENT
MONTHS
WIKIPEDIA
VOLUNTEERS
HAVE
GONE
ON
A
CAMPAIGN
TO
DELETE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
PAGES
THAT
DON
T
MEET
THE
TRIBE
VAGUE
STANDARDS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
FLORENCE
NIBART
DEVOUARD
THE
CHAIRWOMAN
OF
THE
WIKIPEDIA
BOARD
IS
ACTIVELY
CAMPAIGNING
TO
ENSURE
THAT
NO
ONE
MAKES
PARTICULARLY
LARGE
DONATIONS
TO
THE
FOUNDATION
SHE
WAS
QUOTED
BY
THE
NEW
YORK
TIMES
AS
SAYING
THAT
SHE
WOULD
MAKE
SOME
NOISE
IF
AN
AGGRESSIVE
OUTSIDER
WAS
TO
TRY
TO
BECOME
A
BOARD
MEMBER
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
A
TRIBE
LIKE
THIS
IF
YOUR
GOAL
IS
TO
MAKE
CHANGE
IT
FOOLISH
TO
TRY
TO
CHANGE
THE
WORLDVIEW
OF
THE
MAJORITY
IF
THE
MAJORITY
IS
FOCUSED
ON
MAINTAINING
THE
STATUS
QUO
THE
OPPORTUNITY
IS
TO
CARVE
OUT
A
NEW
TRIBE
TO
FIND
THE
RABBLE
ROUSERS
AND
CHANGE
LOVERS
WHO
ARE
SEEKING
NEW
LEADERSHIP
AND
RUN
WITH
THEM
INSTEAD
YES
I
THINK
IT
OKAY
TO
ABANDON
THE
BIG
ESTABLISHED
STUCK
TRIBE
IT
OKAY
TO
SAY
TO
THEM
YOU
RE
NOT
GOING
WHERE
I
NEED
TO
GO
AND
THERE
NO
WAY
I
M
GOING
TO
PERSUADE
ALL
OF
YOU
TO
FOLLOW
ME
SO
RATHER
THAN
STANDING
HERE
WATCHING
THE
OPPORTUNITIES
FADE
AWAY
I
M
HEADING
OFF
I
M
BETTING
SOME
OF
YOU
THE
BEST
OF
YOU
WILL
FOLLOW
ME
POSSIBILITY
OF
RISK
I
WAS
LISTENING
TO
A
TALKING
HEAD
ON
THE
RADIO
AND
HE
WAS
PRATTLING
ON
ABOUT
A
PROBABILITY
OF
RISK
RELATED
TO
SOME
COURSE
OF
ACTION
IN
THE
FUTURE
PEOPLE
ARE
SO
AFRAID
OF
RISK
THEY
CAN
T
EVEN
USE
THE
WORD
RISK
AFTER
ALL
IS
A
PROBABILITY
OF
FAILURE
RIGHT
SO
THIS
GUY
WAS
WARNING
US
OF
A
PROBABILITY
OF
A
PROBABILITY
HE
COULDN
T
EVEN
SAY
IT
IT
ALL
A
RISK
ALWAYS
THAT
NOT
TRUE
ACTUALLY
THE
ONLY
EXCEPTION
IT
A
CERTAINTY
THAT
THERE
RISK
THE
SAFER
YOU
PLAY
YOUR
PLANS
FOR
THE
FUTURE
THE
RISKIER
IT
ACTUALLY
IS
THAT
BECAUSE
THE
WORLD
IS
CERTAINLY
DEFINITELY
AND
MORE
THAN
POSSIBLY
CHANGING
WHEN
TRIBES
REPLACE
WHAT
YOU
RE
USED
TO
THE
BRILLIANT
VENTURE
CAPITALIST
FRED

ABOUT

WHATEVER
SERVES
HE
QUOTES
RONALD
COASE
THE
NOBEL
LAUREATE
IN
ECONOMICS
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
TRANSACTION
COSTS
TO
USING
THE
MARKET
THE
COST
OF
OBTAINING
A
GOOD
OR
SERVICE
VIA
THE
MARKET
IS
ACTUALLY
MORE
THAN
JUST
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
GOOD
OTHER
COSTS
INCLUDING
SEARCH
AND
INFORMATION
COSTS
BARGAINING
COSTS
KEEPING
TRADE
SECRETS
AND
POLICING
AND
ENFORCEMENT
COSTS
CAN
ALL
POTENTIALLY
ADD
TO
THE
COST
OF
PROCURING
SOMETHING
WITH
A
FIRM
THIS
SUGGESTS
THAT
FIRMS
WILL
ARISE
WHEN
THEY
CAN
ARRANGE
TO
PRODUCE
WHAT
THEY
NEED
INTERNALLY
AND
SOMEHOW
AVOID
THESE
COSTS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WE
START
FORMAL
ORGANIZATIONS
WHEN
IT
CHEAPER
THAN
LEADING
A
TRIBE
INSTEAD
HAVING
EMPLOYEES
FOR
EXAMPLE
GIVES
YOU
A
TIGHT
INTERACTION
OF
COMMUNICATION
AND
OUTPUT
THAT
USED
TO
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
ACCOMPLISH
FROM
A
LESS
FORMAL
TRIBE
HAVING
SOLDIERS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
SEEN
AS
MORE
RELIABLE
THAN
EARNING
THE
TRUST
AND
SUPPORT
OF
THE
ENTIRE
POPULATION
THE
INTERNET
CHANGES
THIS
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
BUILD
A
BIGGER
FASTER
CHEAPER
TRIBE
THAN
YOU
USED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
THE
NEW
ECONOMY
CHANGES
THIS
BECAUSE
THE
TRANSACTION
COSTS
ARE
FALLING
FAST
WHILE
THE
COSTS
OF
FORMAL
ORGANIZATIONS
OFFICES
BENEFITS
MANAGEMENT
KEEP
INCREASING
MANY
BIG
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
GETTING
BIGGER
AS
A
WAY
OF
FIGHTING
OFF
THE
POWER
OF
TRIBES
THEY
BUY
OTHER
COMPANIES
HOPING
THAT
THE
FORMAL
NATURE
OF
THEIR
BIGNESS
WILL
SOMEHOW
SUCCESSFULLY
FIGHT
OFF
THE
FLEXIBLE
FAST
AND
SOMETIMES
FREE
POWER
OF
THE
TRIBE
I
THINK
THAT
UNLIKELY
INITIATIVE
THE
TIMID
LEAVE
A
VACUUM
WORKERS
IN
THE
BALLOON
FACTORY
ARE
ALWAYS
AFRAID
PARTICULARLY
OF
SOMETHING
HAPPENING
THINGS
THAT
HAPPEN
ARE
RARELY
GOOD
BECAUSE
THEY
DISTURB
THE
STATUS
QUO
THAT
WHY
INITIATIVE
IS
SUCH
AN
ASTONISHINGLY
SUCCESSFUL
TOOL
BECAUSE
IT
RARE
EVEN
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
ACTION
A
FEW
NEW
IDEAS
OR
A
TINY
BIT
OF
INITIATIVE
CAN
FILL
THE
VACUUM
IT
A
BIG

SPILL
JUST

PEOPLE
NOTICE
WHEN
BARBARA
BARRY
THE
NOW
FAMOUS
FURNITURE
DESIGNER
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
A
MANUFACTURING
PARTNER
FOR
HER
FIRST
LINE
OF
SOFAS
SHE
INVITED
EXECUTIVES
FROM
A
LEADING
MANUFACTURER
TO
HER
SHOWROOM
IN
LOS
ANGELES
BEFORE
SHE
DID
THAT
THOUGH
SHE
TOOK
SOME
INITIATIVE
FIRST
SHE
MANAGED
TO
PLACE
A
WHOLESALE
ORDER
FOR
REAMS
OF
FABRIC
THAT
THE
MANUFACTURER
TRADITIONALLY
USED
ON
ITS
OWN
FURNITURE
SHE
RENTED
AN
OFFICE
BIG
ENOUGH
TO
TURN
INTO
A
SHOWROOM
SHE
DESIGNED
A
LINE
OF
FURNITURE
THAT
WAS
BOLD
AND
EVEN
BREATHTAKING
AND
THEN
SHE
HAD
A
LOCAL
SHOP
BUILD
ONE
OF
EACH
PIECE
UPHOLSTERED
IN
THE
COMPANY
SIGNATURE
FABRIC
WHEN
THE
EXECUTIVES
ARRIVED
EXPECTING
A
SALES
PITCH
AND
SOME
DRAWINGS
THEY
SAW
FINISHED
SOFAS
MADE
FROM
THEIR
MATERIALS
WITH
THEIR
BRAND
LABEL
SEWN
ON
AFTER
THE
FACT
IT
EASY
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
WASN
T
MUCH
A
FEW
THOUSAND
DOLLARS
WORTH
OF
CUSTOM
FURNITURE
BUT
IN
THAT
MOMENT
FOR
THAT
INDUSTRY
IT
WAS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
IT
CHANGED
THE
RULES
BARBARA
WASN
T
MANAGING
HER
CAREER
OR
ASKING
PERMISSION
FROM
THE
FURNITURE
EXECUTIVES
SHE
WAS
LEADING
AND
ENJOYING
EVERY
MOMENT
OF
IT
THE
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
NEED
INNOVATION
THE
MOST
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
DO
THE
MOST
TO
STOP
IT
FROM
HAPPENING
IT
A
BIT
OF
A
PARADOX
BUT
ONCE
YOU
SEE
IT
IT
A
TREMENDOUS
OPPORTUNITY
STUCK
ON

MY

THAT
TOO
MANY

GET
STUCK
ON
STUPID
I
M
IMAGINING
THAT
YOUR

AREN
T
STUPID
BUT
WHEN
THE
WORLD
CHANGES
THE
RULES
CHANGE
AND
IF
YOU
INSIST
ON
PLAYING
TODAY

BY
YESTERDAY
RULES
YOU
RE
STUCK
STUCK
WITH
A
STUPID
STRATEGY
BECAUSE
THE

CHANGED
SOME

ARE

OTHERS
MOVE
QUICKLY
IN
A

THAT

STARTED
AN

DEBATE
ABOUT

OF

FUND
RAISING
THIS

STREAM
IS
THE
LIFEBLOOD
OF
MOST
NONPROFITS
AND
IT
DRYING
UP
THE

OF

IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
SOLUTION
TO
ALL
PROBLEMS
BUT
AS
MARK
POINTS
OUT
IT
NOT
THE
ERA
OF
CHEAP
DIRECT

AND
HIGH

RATES
IN

IS
OVER
THE
ECONOMICS
OF

ARE
FAILING
THAT
IS
MORE
OR
LESS
AN
UNCONTROVERTED
FACT
IT
COSTS
MORE
TO

AND
FEWER
NEW

COME
BACK
WITH

THIS

HAS
BEEN

SOMEWHAT
BY

BY

YOU
ALREADY
HAVE
BUT
SOONER
OR
LATER
THE

CRISIS
IS
GOING
TO
AFFECT
BOTTOM
LINES
FOR
SOME
IT
ALREADY
HAS
WHAT
CURRENTLY
PASSES
FOR
AN
ONLINE
FUNDRAISING
MODEL
IS
AT
BEST
A
STOPGAP
MY
TAKE
I
DESPAIR
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
TOP
FIFTY
NONPROFITS
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
THESE
ARE
THE
BIG
GUYS
AND
THEY
RE
STUCK
FAR
MORE
THAN
THE
FORTUNE
NOT
KNOWN
FOR
BEING
CUTTING
EDGE
IN
THEMSELVES
THE
TOP
CHARITIES
RARELY
CHANGE
IF
YOU
RE
BIG
YOU
RE
USED
TO
BEING
BIG
AND
YOU
EXPECT
TO
STAY
BIG
THAT
MEANS
THAT
GENERATION
AFTER
GENERATION
OF
STAFF
HAS
BEEN
HIRED
TO
KEEP
DOING
WHAT
WORKING
BIG
RISKS
AND
CRAZY
SCHEMES
ARE
CERTAINLY
FROWNED
UPON
THE
GOOD
NEWS
IS
THIS
THE
INTERNET
IS
NOT
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
DIRECT
MAIL
FUND
RAISING
IT
IS
IN
FACT
SOMETHING
MUCH
BIGGER
THAN
THAT
FOR
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
NONPROFIT
AS
SOON
AS
COMMERCE
STARTED
ONLINE
MANY
NONPROFITS
GENERATED
LOTS
OF
INCOME
FROM
THEIR
WEB
SITES
THIS
WAS
MISTAKENLY
CHALKED
UP
TO
BRILLIANT
CONVERSION
AND
SMART
MARKETING
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
THE
RESULT
OF
TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED
DONORS
USING
A
MORE
CONVENIENT
METHOD
TO
SEND
IN
MONEY
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
SENT
IN
ANYWAY
THE
BIG
WIN
IS
IN
CHANGING
THE
VERY
NATURE
OF
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
SUPPORT
A
CHARITY
THE
IDEA
OF
I
GAVE
AT
THE
OFFICE
AND
OF
GIVING
MONEY
IN
THE
LAST
WEEK
IN
DECEMBER
SPEAKS
TO
OBLIGATION
MANY
PEOPLE
DONATE
TO
SATISFY
A
GUILTY
FEELING
OR
TO
PLEASE
A
FRIEND
THIS
DOESN
T
SCALE
NOT
ONE
BIT
IT
SUPER
EASY
TO
IGNORE
A
DIRECT
MAIL
SOLICITATION
WHEN
ALL
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
HIT
DELETE
AND
NO
ONE
NOTICES
THE
BIG
WIN
IS
IN
TURNING
DONORS
INTO
PATRONS
AND
ACTIVISTS
AND
PARTICIPANTS
THE
BIGGEST
DONORS
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
NOT
ONLY
GIVE
BUT
ALSO
DO
THE
WORK
THE
ONES
WHO
MAKE
THE
SOUP
OR
FEED
THE
HUNGRY
OR
HANG
THE
ART
MY
MOM
WAS
A
VOLUNTEER
FOR
YEARS
AT
THE
ALBRIGHT
KNOX
ART
GALLERY
IN
BUFFALO
NEW
YORK
AND
THERE
NO
DOUBT
AT
ALL
THAT
WE
GAVE
MORE
MONEY
TO
THE
MUSEUM
THAN
WE
WOULD
HAVE
IF
THEY
D
SENT
US
A
FLYER
ONCE
A
MONTH
THE
INTERNET
ALLOWS
SOME
ORGANIZATIONS
TO
EMBRACE
LONG
DISTANCE
INVOLVEMENT
IT
LETS
CHARITIES
FLIP
THE
FUNNEL
NOT
THROUGH
SOME
SIMPLE
HAND
WAVING
BUT
BY
REORGANIZING
AROUND
THE
IDEA
OF
ENGAGEMENT
ONLINE
THIS
IS
THE
NEW
LEVERAGE
IT
MEANS
OPENING
YOURSELF
UP
TO
VOLUNTEERS
AND
ENCOURAGING
THEM
TO
NETWORK
TO
CONNECT
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
YES
EVEN
TO
MUTINY
IT
MEANS
GIVING
EVERY
ONE
OF
YOUR
PROFESSIONALS
A
BLOG
AND
THE
FREEDOM
TO
USE
IT
IT
MEANS
MIXING
IT
UP
WITH
VOLUNTEERS
SO
THEY
HAVE
SOMETHING
TRULY
AT
STAKE
THIS
IS
UNDERSTANDABLY
SCARY
FOR
MANY
NONPROFITS
BUT
I
M
NOT
SO
SURE
YOU
HAVE
A
CHOICE
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
ABANDON
THE
OLD
WAYS
TODAY
OF
COURSE
NOT
BUT
RESPONSIBLE
STEWARDSHIP
REQUIRES
THAT
YOU
FIND
AND
EMPOWER
THE
HERETICS
AND
GIVE
THEM
THE
FLEXIBILITY
TO
BUILD
SOMETHING
NEW
INSTEAD
OF
TRYING
TO
FORCE
THE
INTERNET
TO
ACT
LIKE
DIRECT
MAIL
WITH
FREE
STAMPS
THE
POSTURE
OF
A
LEADER
IF
YOU
HEAR
MY
IDEA
BUT
DON
T
BELIEVE
IT
THAT
NOT
YOUR
FAULT
IT
MINE
IF
YOU
SEE
MY
NEW
PRODUCT
BUT
DON
T
BUY
IT

MY

NOT
YOURS

YOU
ATTEND

MY
FAULT
TOO
IF
I
FAIL

THAT
SUPPORTS
MY

THAT
DUE
TO
MY
LACK
OF

M
TEACHING
I

THE
OTHER
CRITICAL

THAT

THE

IN

WHY

SO
NOW

A
GOOD

A
DEFINITION
FOR

ARCHITECTURE
HERE
ONE
AN

IS
THE
SET
OF
SIGNIFICANT

ABOUT
THE

OF

THE

THE

AND

REGARDLESS
OF
THE

AND
THERE
ARE
MANY
THE
COMMON
THEME
IN
ALL

DEFINITIONS
IS
THAT
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE

A

A

QUESTION
HOW
DO
WE

WE
COULD
CREATE

IT
COULD

BE
A
NIGHTMARE

MAINTAIN
BUT
IT
ISN
T
THE
RECOMMENDED
APPROACH
IN
THE
SPIRIT
OF
OO
THINKING
SO
WHAT
IS
THE
RECOMMENDED
APPROACH
ANSWER
TO
CREATE
SOFTWARE
OBJECTS
WITH
NAMES
AND
INFORMATION
SIMILAR
TO
THE
REAL
WORLD
DOMAIN
AND
ASSIGN
APPLICATION
LOGIC
RESPONSIBILITIES
TO
THEM
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
OF
POS
THERE
ARE
SALES
AND
PAYMENTS
SO
IN
SOFTWARE
WE
CREATE
A
SALE
AND
PAYMENT
CLASS
AND
GIVE
THEM
APPLICATION
LOGIC
RESPONSIBILITIES
THIS
KIND
OF
SOFTWARE
OBJECT
IS
CALLED
A
DOMAIN
OBJECT
IT
REPRESENTS
A

LOGIC
FOR
EXAMPLE
A

OBJECT
BEING
ABLE
TO

THIS
WAY
LEADS

WHAT
THE

THIS
IS
ANOTHER
KEY
POINT
THERE
A
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE

AND
THE

WE
LOOK
TO
THE

WE

WHAT
IF

ARE
JUST
STARTING

AND
WE
HAVE
NOT

DEFINED
ANY

IN

BY

LOOK
TO

THUS
FOR

SINCE

SEE
THAT
A

CONTAINS

THAT
A
CONCEPTUAL
PERSPECTIVE
NOT
A

BUT
OF

WE
CAN
MIRROR
IT
IN
THE

SO
THAT
A

CONTAINS

SQUARE

AND
THEN
CONSISTENT
WITH

THE

GUIDES

EXPERT
BUT
WHY
DOES
EXPERT
GIVE
THIS
ADVICE
THE
ANSWER
IS
FOUND
IN
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
LOW
COUPLING
BRIEFLY
AND
INFORMALLY
COUPLING
IS
A
MEASURE
OF
HOW
STRONGLY
ONE

IF
THERE
IS

THE

IT

OF
THE
CARDINAL
GOALS
IN

THIS

TO

TO

THE
CHOICE
BETWEEN

OTHER

WE
SHOULD
PREFER

IS
LOWER

THE

FOR

AS
WE

DECIDED
IN

I

IN

IF
A

POOR

VERSUS
OUR
ORIGINAL

WHERE

DOES

THE

THUS
THE
OVERALL
COUPLING
IS
LOWER
WITH

AND
ALL
OTHER

BEING
EQUAL
IT
IS
BETTER
THAN
THE

IN
TERMS
OF

THE
GOAL
OF
LOW

AT
A
HIGHER

LEVEL
WHY
IS
LOW
COUPLING
DESIRABLE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WHY
WOULD
WE
WANT
TO

BECAUSE
LOW

TENDS

IN

CONSIDER
YOUR

MEMBERS
RIGOROUS
NOTE
TAKING
AND
FOLLOW
UP
SOME
IMPORTANT
ISSUES
GROUP
WORK
YOUR
GROUP
SHOULD
DIVIDE
THE
TASKS
IN
THE

APPROPRIATELY
SO
THAT
EACH

CAN
WORK
INDEPENDENTLY
OR
IN
A
SMALLER
SUB

MUCH
OF
THE
TIME
HOWEVER
EFFECTIVE
GROUP
INTERACTIONS
WILL
STILL
BE
MANDATORY
TO
COMPLETE
THE

SUCCESSFULLY
AS
IN
CMPT
ONLY
MORE
SO
YOU
ARE
ENCOURAGED
TO
COMMUNICATE
ELECTRONICALLY
USING
YOUR
MECHANISM
OF
CHOICE
IN
A
PRIVATE

EACH
LECTURE
MEETING
WILL
PROVIDE
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
MEET
DURING
THE
FIRST
MINUTES
OF

BUT
YOU
SHOULD
ALL
ALSO
PHYSICALLY
MEET
SEPARATELY
AT

ONCE
A

TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
EVERYBODY
IS
ON
THE

AN
AGENDA
FOR
EACH
SUCH

SHOULD
BE
PREPARED
BEFOREHAND
AND
MINUTES
OF
THE

SHOULD
BE

G
CAUSED

ETC
START
TO
OCCUR
THEY
SHOULD
BE
NIPPED
IN
THE
BUD
BEFORE
THEY
DEVELOP
INTO
REAL
OBSTACLES
TO
SUCCESS
YOU
SHOULD
TRY
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEMS
YOURSELVES
PERHAPS
AT
THE
REGULAR
MEETINGS
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
YOU
SHOULD
APPROACH
THE
HIGHER
MANAGEMENT
TUTOR
AND
IF
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
THE
PROFESSOR
REMEMBER
THAT
MANAGING
SUCH
A
LARGE
GROUP
HAS
ITS
OWN
SPECIAL
DISADVANTAGES
TOO
MANY
CATS
ALL
GOING
THEIR
OWN
DIRECTION
BUT
ALSO
ITS
OWN
SPECIAL
ADVANTAGES
ONE
PROBLEM
WORKER
DOESN
T
USUALLY
BRING
DOWN
THE

WHILE
EXPERIENCE
SUGGESTS
THAT
SOME
MEMBERS
OF
THE

MAY
NOT
PARTICIPATE
FULLY
AT
ALL
TIMES
THROUGHOUT
THE

THEY
DO
SO
AT
THEIR

PERIL
AND
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
THAT

WELCOME
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
WHEN
AND
IF
THEY
CHOOSE
TO
MAKE
AN

AT

MILESTONE
AND
IN
THE

ALL
APPROPRIATE

WE

IN
THIS

WE
WILL
GO
ONE

AND
ACTUALLY
LOOK
AT
THE

OF
THE

OF

IT
IS
EASY
TO
LOOK
AT
THE

OF
A
SPECIFIC
FIELD
OF
AN
OBJECT
WHOSE
NAME
AND
TYPE
ARE
KNOWN
WHEN
YOU
WRITE
A
PROGRAM
BUT
REFLECTION
LETS
YOU
LOOK
AT
FIELDS
OF
OBJECTS
THAT
WERE
NOT
KNOWN
AT
COMPILE
TIME
THE
KEY
METHOD
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
EXAMINATION
IS
THE
GET
METHOD
IN
THE
FIELD
CLASS
IF
F
IS
AN
OBJECT
OF
TYPE
FIELD
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONE
OBTAINED
FROM
GETDECLAREDFIELDS
AND
OBJ
IS
AN

OF
THE

OF
WHICH
F
IS
A

THEN
F

RETURNS
AN

WHOSE

ACTUALLY
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
CODE
SINCE
THE

THE

WILL
THROW
AN

YOU
CAN
ONLY
USE

TO
GET
THE

THE

LETS
YOU
FIND

AN

HAS

IT
WON

YOU
READ
THE

OF

UNLESS
YOU

THE

BEHAVIOR

IF

THAT
WE
HAVE

USEFUL
WHEN

PLACE
COMMON
OPERATIONS
AND

IN

THIS
IS
WHY
WE
PUT
THE

FIELD
INTO
THE
PERSON
CLASS
INSTEAD
OF
REPLICATING
IT
IN
THE
EMPLOYEE
AND
STUDENT
CLASSES
DON
T
USE
PROTECTED
FIELDS
SOME
PROGRAMMERS
THINK
IT
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
DEFINE
MOST
INSTANCE
FIELDS
AS
PROTECTED
JUST
IN
CASE
SO
THAT
SUBCLASSES
CAN
ACCESS
THESE
FIELDS
IF
THEY
NEED
TO
HOWEVER
THE
PROTECTED
MECHANISM
DOESN
T
GIVE
MUCH
PROTECTION
FOR
TWO
REASONS
FIRST
THE
SET
OF
SUBCLASSES
IS
UNBOUNDED
ANYONE
CAN
FORM
A
SUBCLASS
OF
YOUR
CLASSES
AND
THEN
WRITE
CODE
THAT
DIRECTLY
ACCESSES
PROTECTED
INSTANCE
FIELDS
THEREBY
BREAKING
ENCAPSULATION
AND
SECOND
IN
THE
JAVA
PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE
ALL
CLASSES
IN
THE
SAME
PACKAGE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
PROTECTED
FIELDS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
ARE
SUBCLASSES
HOWEVER
PROTECTED
METHODS
CAN
BE
USEFUL
TO
INDICATE
METHODS
THAT
ARE
NOT
READY
FOR
GENERAL
USE
AND
SHOULD
BE
REDEFINED
IN
SUBCLASSES
USE
INHERITANCE
TO
MODEL
THE
IS
A
RELATIONSHIP
INHERITANCE
IS
A
HANDY
CODE
SAVER
BUT
SOMETIMES
PEOPLE
OVERUSE
IT
FOR
EXAMPLE
SUPPOSE
WE
NEED
A
CONTRACTOR
CLASS
CONTRACTORS
HAVE
NAMES
AND
HIRE
DATES
BUT
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
SALARIES
INSTEAD
THEY
ARE
PAID
BY
THE
HOUR
AND
THEY
DO
NOT
STAY
AROUND
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
GET
A
RAISE
THERE
IS
THE
TEMPTATION
TO
FORM
A
SUBCLASS
CONTRACTOR
FROM
EMPLOYEE
AND
ADD
AN
HOURLYWAGE
FIELD
CLASS
CONTRACTOR
EXTENDS
EMPLOYEE
PRIVATE
DOUBLE
HOURLYWAGE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
NOW
EACH
CONTRACTOR
OBJECT
HAS
BOTH
A
SALARY
AND
HOURLY
WAGE
FIELD
IT
WILL
CAUSE
YOU
NO
END
OF
GRIEF
WHEN
YOU
IMPLEMENT
METHODS
FOR
PRINTING
PAYCHECKS
OR
TAX
FORMS
YOU
WILL
END
UP
WRITING
MORE
CODE
THAN
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
WRITTEN
BY
NOT
INHERITING
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
CONTRACTOR
EMPLOYEE

FAILS
THE
IS
A
TEST
A

IS
NOT
A
SPECIAL
CASE
OF
AN
EMPLOYEE
DON
T
USE
INHERITANCE
UNLESS
ALL
INHERITED
METHODS
MAKE
SENSE
SUPPOSE
WE
WANT
TO
WRITE
A
HOLIDAY
CLASS
SURELY
EVERY
HOLIDAY
IS
A
DAY
AND
DAYS
CAN
BE
EXPRESSED
AS
INSTANCES
OF
THE
GREGORIANCALENDAR
CLASS
SO
WE
CAN
USE
INHERITANCE

UNFORTUNATELY
THE

NOT
CLOSED
UNDER
THE
INHERITED

ONE
OF
THE
PUBLIC
METHODS
OF

IS

THEREFORE
INHERITANCE
IS
NOT
APPROPRIATE
IN
THIS

DON
T
CHANGE
THE
EXPECTED

WHEN
YOU

A

THE

APPLIES
NOT
JUST
TO
SYNTAX
BUT
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
TO
BEHAVIOR
WHEN
YOU

A

YOU
SHOULD
NOT
UNREASONABLY
CHANGE
ITS

THE
COMPILER
CAN

HELP
YOU
IT
CANNOT

WHETHER
YOUR
REDEFINITIONS

FOR

YOU

REASONABLE

CAN

ABOUT
WHAT
THE

IS

ARGUE
THAT
THE

BECAUSE

IGNORES
IT
THESE
DISCUSSIONS
ARE
POINTLESS
IF
THEY
OCCUR
IN
A
VACUUM
ULTIMATELY
WHAT
MATTERS
IS
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
CIRCUMVENT
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
DESIGN
WHEN
YOU
OVERRIDE
METHODS
IN

USE
POLYMORPHISM
NOT

IF
SO
MAKE
THE

A
METHOD

TYPES
THEN
YOU
CAN

INNER

AN

IS
NOT
A

BUT
A
SET
OF
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
THE

THAT
WANT
TO
CONFORM

TYPICALLY
THE
SUPPLIER
OF
SOME

IF

THE

BUT
UNDER

CONDITION
THE

THIS
MEANS
THAT
ANY

THE

IS

AND
THE

THEN
YOU

OF

ALL

OF
AN

ARE

FOR
THAT
REASON
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO

THE
KEYWORD
PUBLIC
WHEN
DECLARING
A

IN

OF

THERE
IS
AN
ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENT
THAT

THE

MUST

TO

THIS

IN

SUPPLYING

YOU

HOWEVER
THERE

SOME
DIFFERENCES

WE

HOWEVER

WHAT

OF

IT

METHOD
THAT
EMINENTLY
REASONABLE
THERE
NEEDS

SOME
WAY
FOR

BUT
WHY
CAN
T
THE

CLASS
SIMPLY
PROVIDE
A
COMPARETO
METHOD
WITHOUT

THE

THE
REASON
FOR

IS
THAT
THE

IS
STRONGLY

THE

NOTE
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
THAT
THE

THINK

THERE
ARE
TWO
BENEFITS
NAME
CONTROL
AND
ACCESS
CONTROL
THE
NAME
ITERATOR
IS
NESTED
INSIDE
THE
LINKEDLIST
CLASS
SO
IT
IS
KNOWN
EXTERNALLY
AS
LINKEDLIST
ITERATOR
AND
CANNOT
CONFLICT
WITH
ANOTHER
CLASS
CALLED
ITERATOR
IN
JAVA
THIS
BENEFIT
IS
NOT
AS
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
JAVA
PACKAGES
GIVE
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
NAME
CONTROL
NOTE
THAT
THE
LINK
CLASS
IS
IN
THE
PRIVATE
PART
OF
THE
LINKEDLIST
CLASS
IT
IS
COMPLETELY
HIDDEN
FROM
ALL
OTHER

FOR
THAT
REASON
IT
IS
SAFE
TO
MAKE
ITS
DATA
FIELDS
PUBLIC
THEY
CAN
BE
ACCESSED
BY
THE
METHODS
OF
THE
LINKEDLIST
CLASS
WHICH
HAS
A
LEGITIMATE
NEED
TO

THEM
AND
THEY
ARE
NOT

ELSEWHERE
IN

THIS
KIND
OF
CONTROL
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
UNTIL

WERE
INTRODUCED
HOWEVER
THE
JAVA
INNER

HAVE
AN
ADDITIONAL
FEATURE
THAT
MAKES
THEM
RICHER
AND
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
NESTED

IN

AN

THIS

HOWEVER
FOR

THE

SUPPOSE
YOU

WHOSE
EXACT

YOU

THIS
IS
A
DIFFICULT

TO
CONSTRUCT
AN

YOU
CAN
SIMPLY
USE
THE

OR
USE

TO
FIND
A

BUT
YOU
CAN

INSTANTIATE
AN

YOU

THIS

GENERATE

THEN

NATURALLY

IT
ALSO
REQUIRES

TOGETHER
WITH

THE

THE

SWING
WAS
AVAILABLE
AS
AN
EXTENSION
TO
JAVA
AND
BECAME
A
PART
OF
THE
STANDARD
LIBRARY
IN
JAVA
SE
SINCE
AS
DUKE
ELLINGTON
SAID
IT
DON
T
MEAN
A
THING
IF
IT
AIN
T
GOT
THAT
SWING
SWING
IS
NOW
THE
OFFICIAL

SWING

CLASSES
JFC
THE
FULL
JFC
IS
VAST
AND
CONTAINS
FAR
MORE
THAN
THE
SWING
GUI
TOOLKIT
BESIDES
THE
SWING
COMPONENTS
IT
ALSO
HAS
AN
ACCESSIBILITY
API
A

AND
A
DRAG

NOTE
SWING
IS
NOT
A
COMPLETE
REPLACEMENT
FOR
THE
AWT
IT
IS
BUILT
ON
TOP
OF
THE

ARCHITECTURE
SWING
SIMPLY
GIVES
YOU
MORE

WHENEVER
YOU
WRITE

YOU
USE
THE

OF

HANDLING
FROM

ON
WE
SAY
SWING
WHEN
WE

WILL
BE
SOMEWHAT
SLOWER
TO

THAN
THE

USED
BY

IN
OUR

ON
ANY
REASONABLY
MODERN

THE

SHOULDN
T
BE
A
PROBLEM
ON
THE
OTHER

THE
REASONS
TO
CHOOSE
SWING
ARE
OVERWHELMING
SWING
HAS
A
RICH
AND
CONVENIENT
SET
OF
USER
INTERFACE
ELEMENTS
SWING
HAS
FEW
DEPENDENCIES
ON
THE
UNDERLYING
PLATFORM
IT
IS
THEREFORE
LESS
PRONE
TO
PLATFORMSPECIFIC
BUGS
SWING
GIVES
A
CONSISTENT
USER
EXPERIENCE
ACROSS
PLATFORMS
STILL
THE
THIRD
PLUS
IS
ALSO
A
POTENTIAL
DRAWBACK
IF
THE
USER
INTERFACE
ELEMENTS
LOOK
THE
SAME
ON
ALL
PLATFORMS
THEY
LOOK
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
NATIVE
CONTROLS
SO
USERS
WILL
BE
LESS
FAMILIAR
WITH
THEM
SWING
SOLVES
THIS
PROBLEM
IN
A
VERY
ELEGANT
WAY
PROGRAMMERS

IT

THE

YOU

IF

THAT
IS
NOT
HOW
SWING
WORKS
SIMPLY
CONSTRUCTING
A

DOES
NOT
AUTOMATICALLY
DISPLAY

INVISIBLE
THAT
GIVES
THE

THE

NOTE
BEFORE
THE
JAVA

APPEARED
PROGRAMMERS
USED
METHODS
OF
THE
GRAPHICS
CLASS
SUCH
AS
DRAWRECTANGLE
TO
DRAW
SHAPES
SUPERFICIALLY
THE
OLD
STYLE
METHOD
CALLS
LOOK
A
BIT
SIMPLER
HOWEVER
BY
USING
THE
JAVA
LIBRARY
YOU
KEEP
YOUR
OPTIONS
OPEN
YOU
CAN
LATER
ENHANCE
YOUR
DRAWINGS
WITH
SOME
OF
THE
MANY
TOOLS
THAT
THE
JAVA
LIBRARY
SUPPLIES
USING
THE
JAVA
SHAPE
CLASSES
INTRODUCES
SOME
COMPLEXITY
UNLIKE
THE
DRAW
METHODS
WHICH
USED
INTEGER
PIXEL
COORDINATES
JAVA
SHAPES
USE
FLOATING
POINT
COORDINATES
IN
MANY
CASES
THAT
IS
A
GREAT
CONVENIENCE
BECAUSE
IT
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
SPECIFY
YOUR
SHAPES
IN
COORDINATES
THAT
ARE
MEANINGFUL
TO
YOU
SUCH
AS
MILLIMETERS
OR
INCHES
AND
THEN
TRANSLATE
THEM
TO
PIXELS
THE
JAVA
LIBRARY
USES
SINGLEPRECISION
FLOAT
QUANTITIES
FOR
MANY
OF
ITS
INTERNAL
FLOATING
POINT
CALCULATIONS
SINGLE
PRECISION
IS
SUFFICIENT
AFTER
ALL
THE
ULTIMATE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
GEOMETRIC
COMPUTATIONS
IS
TO
SET
PIXELS
ON
THE
SCREEN
OR
PRINTER
AS
LONG
AS
ANY
ROUNDOFF
ERRORS
STAY
WITHIN
ONE
PIXEL
THE
VISUAL
OUTCOME
IS
NOT
AFFECTED
FURTHERMORE
FLOAT
COMPUTATIONS
ARE
FASTER
ON
SOME
PLATFORMS
AND
FLOAT
VALUES
REQUIRE
HALF
THE
STORAGE
OF
DOUBLE
VALUES
HOWEVER
MANIPULATING
FLOAT
VALUES
IS
SOMETIMES
INCONVENIENT
FOR
THE
PROGRAMMER
BECAUSE
JAVA
IS
ADAMANT
ABOUT
REQUIRING
CASTS
WHEN
CONVERTING
DOUBLE
VALUES
INTO
FLOAT
VALUES
FOR
EXAMPLE
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
STATEMENT
FLOAT
F
ERROR
THIS
STATEMENT
DOES
NOT
COMPILE
BECAUSE
THE
CONSTANT
HAS
TYPE
DOUBLE
AND
THE
COMPILER
IS
NERVOUS
ABOUT
LOSS
OF
PRECISION
THE
REMEDY
IS
TO
ADD
AN
F
SUFFIX
TO
THE
FLOATING
POINT
CONSTANT
FLOAT
F
OK
NOW
CONSIDER
THIS
STATEMENT
R
FLOAT

GETWIDTH
ERROR
THIS
STATEMENT
DOES

COMPILE
EITHER
FOR
THE

REASON
THE

METHOD

THIS
TIME
THE
REMEDY
IS
TO
PROVIDE
A
CAST

F
FLOAT
R
GETWIDTH
OK
THESE
SUFFIXES
AND
CASTS
ARE
A
BIT
OF
A
PAIN
SO
THE
DESIGNERS
OF
THE
LIBRARY
DECIDED
TO
SUPPLY
TWO
VERSIONS
OF
EACH

ONE
WITH
FLOAT
COORDINATES
FOR
FRUGAL
PROGRAMMERS
AND
ONE
WITH

FOR
THE
LAZY
ONES
IN
THIS
BOOK
WE
FALL
INTO
THE
SECOND

YOU
WILL

SHOW
YOU
HOW

A

APPROACH
FOR

BASICS
OF
EVENT
HANDLING
ANY
OPERATING
ENVIRONMENT
THAT
SUPPORTS
GUIS
CONSTANTLY
MONITORS
EVENTS
SUCH
AS
KEYSTROKES
OR
MOUSE
CLICKS
THE
OPERATING
ENVIRONMENT
REPORTS
THESE
EVENTS
TO
THE
PROGRAMS
THAT
ARE
RUNNING
EACH
PROGRAM
THEN
DECIDES
WHAT
IF
ANYTHING
TO
DO
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THESE
EVENTS
IN
LANGUAGES
LIKE
VISUAL
BASIC
THE
CORRESPONDENCE
BETWEEN
EVENTS
AND
CODE
IS
OBVIOUS
ONE
WRITES
CODE
FOR
EACH
SPECIFIC
EVENT
OF
INTEREST
AND
PLACES
THE
CODE
IN
WHAT
IS
USUALLY
CALLED
AN
EVENT
PROCEDURE
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
VISUAL
BASIC
BUTTON
NAMED
HELPBUTTON
WOULD
HAVE
A
EVENT
PROCEDURE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
IT
THE
CODE
IN
THIS
PROCEDURE
EXECUTES
WHENEVER
THAT
BUTTON
IS
CLICKED
EACH
VISUAL
BASIC
GUI
COMPONENT
RESPONDS
TO
A
FIXED
SET
OF
EVENTS
AND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
CHANGE
THE
EVENTS
TO
WHICH
IT
RESPONDS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOU
USE
A
LANGUAGE
LIKE
RAW
C
TO
DO
EVENT
DRIVEN
PROGRAMMING
YOU
NEED
TO
WRITE
THE
CODE
THAT
CONSTANTLY
CHECKS
THE
EVENT
QUEUE
FOR
WHAT
THE
OPERATING
ENVIRONMENT
IS
REPORTING
THIS
IS
USUALLY
DONE
BY
ENCASING
YOUR
CODE
IN
A
LOOP
WITH
A
MASSIVE
SWITCH
STATEMENT
THIS
TECHNIQUE
IS
OBVIOUSLY
RATHER
UGLY
AND
IN
ANY
CASE
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
CODE
ITS
ADVANTAGE
IS
THAT
THE
EVENTS
YOU
CAN
RESPOND
TO
ARE
NOT
AS
LIMITED
AS
IN
THE
LANGUAGES
WHICH
LIKE
VISUAL

GO
TO
GREAT

THAT
AN

OUT
WHEN

TYPES
A

COMMAND
TO
ASSOCIATE

YOU
FIRST
NEED
TO

OF

THIS
IS
A
CONVENIENCE
CLASS
THAT
ENCAPSULATES
THE
DESCRIPTION
OF

YOU

TO

THE

YOU
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
CONCEPT
OF
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
A
USER
INTERFACE
CAN
HAVE
MANY
BUTTONS
MENUS
SCROLLBARS
AND
OTHER
COMPONENTS
WHEN
YOU
HIT
A

IT
IS
SENT
TO
THE

THAT

THAT

NOT

DISTINGUISHED
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN

YOU

CARRY
OUT
DIFFERENT

FOR
EXAMPLE
THE

HOWEVER
IN
OUR
CASE
WE
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
SEND
THE

TO
THE

THAT

OTHERWISE
EACH

THE

WOULD
NEED
TO
KNOW
HOW
TO

THE

CTRL
B
AND
CTRL
R
KEYS
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
AND
THE
SWING
DESIGNERS
CAME
UP
WITH
A
CONVENIENT
SOLUTION
EVERY
JCOMPONENT
HAS
THREE
INPUT

THE

WE
BRIEFLY
MENTIONED
EARLIER
EVENT
HANDLING
IN

IS

ORIENTED
WITH
ALL

DESCENDING
FROM
THE

CLASS
IN
THE
JAVA

PACKAGE
THE

NOT

BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
NAME
OF
THE

IN
THE
OLD

MODEL
ALTHOUGH
THE
OLD
MODEL
IS
NOW
DEPRECATED
ITS
CLASSES
ARE
STILL
A
PART
OF

THE

THE

INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE

THAT
THE

SOURCE
COMMUNICATES
TO
ITS
LISTENERS
WHEN
NECESSARY
YOU
CAN
THEN
ANALYZE
THE
EVENT
OBJECTS
THAT
WERE
PASSED
TO
THE
LISTENER
OBJECT
AS
WE
DID
IN
THE
BUTTON
EXAMPLE
WITH
THE
GETSOURCE
AND
GETACTIONCOMMAND
METHODS
SOME
OF
THE

ARE
OF
NO
PRACTICAL
USE
FOR
THE
JAVA
PROGRAMMER
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
AWT
INSERTS
PAINTEVENT
OBJECTS
INTO
THE

QUEUE
BUT
THESE
OBJECTS
ARE
NOT
DELIVERED
TO

JAVA
PROGRAMMERS
DON
T
LISTEN
TO
PAINT
EVENTS
INSTEAD
THEY
OVERRIDE
THE

METHOD
TO
CONTROL
REPAINTING
THE
AWT
ALSO
GENERATES
A

THAT
ARE

ROBOTS
AND
SO
ON
WE
DO
NOT
DISCUSS
THESE
SPECIALIZED
EVENT
TYPES
SEMANTIC
AND
LOW
LEVEL
EVENTS
THE
AWT
MAKES
A
USEFUL
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
LOW
LEVEL
AND
SEMANTIC
EVENTS
A
SEMANTIC
EVENT
IS
ONE
THAT
EXPRESSES
WHAT
THE
USER
IS
DOING
SUCH
AS
CLICKING
THAT
BUTTON
AN

A
SEMANTIC

LOW

THOSE

THAT
MAKE
THIS

CASE
OF
A

THIS
IS
A

A
SERIES
OF
MOUSE
MOVES
AND
A
MOUSE

BUT
ONLY
IF
THE
MOUSE
UP
IS

IT
MIGHT
BE

WHICH
HAPPENS
IF
THE

SELECTS
THE

WITH

AND
THEN
ACTIVATES
IT
WITH

SIMILARLY
ADJUSTING

WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE

OF
SWING
COMPONENTS
WE
FIRST
DISCUSS
THE
CONCEPT
OF
DESIGN
PATTERNS
AND
THEN
LOOK
AT
THE
MODEL

PATTERN
THAT
HAS
GREATLY
INFLUENCED
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
SWING
FRAMEWORK
DESIGN
PATTERNS
WHEN
SOLVING
A
PROBLEM
YOU
DON
T
USUALLY
FIGURE
OUT
A
SOLUTION
FROM
FIRST
PRINCIPLES
INSTEAD
YOU
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
GUIDED
BY
YOUR
PAST
EXPERIENCE
OR
YOU
MAY
ASK
OTHER
EXPERTS
FOR
ADVICE
ON
WHAT
HAS
WORKED
FOR
THEM
DESIGN
PATTERNS
ARE
A
METHOD
FOR
PRESENTING
THIS
EXPERTISE
IN
A
STRUCTURED
WAY
IN
RECENT
YEARS
SOFTWARE
ENGINEERS
HAVE
BEGUN
TO
ASSEMBLE
CATALOGS
OF
SUCH
PATTERNS
THE
PIONEERS
IN
THIS
AREA
WERE
INSPIRED
BY
THE
ARCHITECTURAL
DESIGN
PATTERNS
OF
THE
ARCHITECT
CHRISTOPHER
ALEXANDER
IN
HIS
BOOK
THE
TIMELESS
WAY
OF
BUILDING
OXFORD
UNIVERSITY
PRESS
ALEXANDER
GIVES
A
CATALOG
OF
PATTERNS
FOR
DESIGNING
PUBLIC

PRIVATE

SPACES
HERE
IS
A
TYPICAL
EXAMPLE

EVERYBODY
LOVES

SEATS
BAY

AND
BIG

WITH
LOW
SILLS
AND
COMFORTABLE
CHAIRS
DRAWN
UP
TO
THEM
A
ROOM
WHICH
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
PLACE
LIKE
THIS
SELDOM
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
OR
PERFECTLY
AT
EASE
IF
THE
ROOM
CONTAINS
NO
WINDOW
WHICH
IS
A
PLACE
A
PERSON
IN
THE
ROOM
WILL
BE
TORN
BETWEEN
TWO
FORCES
HE
WANTS
TO
SIT
DOWN
AND
BE
COMFORTABLE
AND
HE
IS
DRAWN
TOWARD
THE
LIGHT
OBVIOUSLY
IF
THE
COMFORTABLE
PLACES
THOSE
PLACES
IN
THE
ROOM
WHERE
YOU
MOST
WANT
TO
SIT
ARE
AWAY
FROM
THE
WINDOWS
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OF
OVERCOMING
THIS
CONFLICT
THEREFORE
IN
EVERY
ROOM
WHERE
YOU
SPEND
ANY
LENGTH
OF
TIME
DURING
THE
DAY
MAKE
AT
LEAST
ONE
WINDOW
INTO
A

PLACE
EACH
PATTERN
IN
ALEXANDER
CATALOG
AS
WELL
AS
THOSE
IN
THE
CATALOGS
OF

FOLLOWS
A
PARTICULAR
FORMAT
THE
PATTERN
FIRST
DESCRIBES
A
CONTEXT
A
SITUATION
THAT
GIVES
RISE
TO
A
DESIGN
PROBLEM
THEN
THE
PROBLEM
IS
EXPLAINED
USUALLY
AS
A
SET
OF
CONFLICTING
FORCES
FINALLY
THE
SOLUTION
SHOWS
A
CONFIGURATION
THAT
BALANCES
THESE
FORCES
IN
THE
WINDOW
PLACE
PATTERN
THE
CONTEXT
IS
A
ROOM
IN
WHICH
YOU
SPEND
ANY
LENGTH
OF
TIME
DURING
THE
DAY
THE
CONFLICTING
FORCES
ARE
THAT
YOU
WANT
TO
SIT
DOWN
AND
BE
COMFORTABLE
AND
THAT
YOU
ARE
DRAWN
TO
THE
LIGHT
THE
SOLUTION
IS
TO
MAKE
A
WINDOW
PLACE
IN
THE
MODEL
VIEW
CONTROLLER
PATTERN
WHICH
WE
WILL
DESCRIBE
IN
THE
NEXT
SECTION
THE

IS

AND
RECEIVES

THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
FORCES
THERE
MAY
BE
MULTIPLE
VISUAL
REPRESENTATIONS
OF
THE
SAME
DATA
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
UPDATED
TOGETHER
THE
VISUAL
REPRESENTATIONS
MAY
CHANGE
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
ACCOMMODATE
VARIOUS
LOOK
AND
FEEL
STANDARDS
THE
INTERACTION
MECHANISMS
MAY
CHANGE
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
SUPPORT

THE
SOLUTION
IS
TO
DISTRIBUTE
RESPONSIBILITIES
INTO
THREE
SEPARATE
INTERACTING
COMPONENTS
THE
MODEL
THE
VIEW
AND
THE

THE

NOT
THE
ONLY

USED
IN

ARE
SEVERAL

THE

LAYOUT
MANAGERS
FOLLOW
THE
STRATEGY

ONE
IMPORTANT
ASPECT
OF
DESIGN
PATTERNS
IS
THAT
THEY
BECOME
PART
OF
THE
CULTURE
PROGRAMMERS
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
WHEN
YOU
TALK
ABOUT

JUST

FOR

OF

IN
THIS

I
LL
SHOW
YOU
MANY

THINGS
THAT
YOU
CAN
DO
WITH

SOME
OF
WHICH
IF
YOU
HAVE
EVER
USED
A
STRONGLY
TYPED
LANGUAGE
SUCH
AS
C
MAY
SURPRISE
YOU
WITH
THEIR
ELEGANCE
AND
SIMPLICITY
ARRAYS
ARE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
WHAT
HAS
MADE
PHP
SO
POPULAR
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
REMOVE
THE
TEDIUM
OF
WRITING
CODE
TO
DEAL
WITH
COMPLICATED

STRUCTURES
THEY
ALSO
PROVIDE
NU
MEROUS
WAYS
TO

WHILE
REMAINING
AMAZINGLY
FAST

WE
VE
ALREADY
LOOKED
AT
ARRAYS
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
CLUSTERS
OF
MATCHBOXES
GLUED
TOGETHER
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
THINK
OF
AN
ARRAY
IS
LIKE
A
STRING
OF
BEADS
WITH
THE
BEADS
REPRESENTING
VARIABLES
THAT
CAN
BE
NUMERIC
STRING
OR
EVEN
OTHER
ARRAYS
THEY
ARE
LIKE
BEAD
STRINGS
BECAUSE
EACH
ELEMENT
HAS
ITS
OWN
LOCATION
AND
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
THE
FIRST
AND
LAST
ONES
EACH
HAS
OTHER
ELEMENTS
ON
EITHER
SIDE
SOME
ARRAYS
ARE
REFERENCED
BY

OTHERS
ALLOW
ALPHANUMERIC

LET
YOU
SORT
THEM
ADD

AND
WALK
THROUGH
THEM
TO
HANDLE
EACH
ITEM
THROUGH
A
SPECIAL
KIND
OF
LOOP
AND
BY
PLACING
ONE
OR
MORE
ARRAYS
INSIDE
ANOTHER
YOU
CAN
CREATE
ARRAYS
OF
TWO
THREE
OR
ANY
NUMBER
OF
DIMENSIONS
NUMERICALLY
INDEXED

LET

THAT
YOU
VE
BEEN

YOU

WEB
PROGRAMS
ARE
OFTEN
CALLED
BY
MANY
USERS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
IF
MORE
THAN
ONE
PERSON
TRIES
TO
WRITE
TO
A
FILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IT
CAN
BECOME
CORRUPTED
AND
IF
ONE
PERSON
WRITES
TO
IT
WHILE
ANOTHER
IS
READING
FROM
IT
THE
FILE
IS
ALL
RIGHT
BUT
THE
PERSON
READING
IT
CAN
GET
ODD
RESULTS
TO
HANDLE
SIMULTANEOUS
USERS
YOU
MUST
USE
THE
FILE

FLOCK
FUNCTION
THIS
FUNCTION
QUEUES
UP
ALL
OTHER
REQUESTS
TO
ACCESS
A
FILE
UNTIL
YOUR
PROGRAM
RELEASES
THE
LOCK
SO
WHENEVER
YOUR
PROGRAMS
USE
WRITE
ACCESS
ON
FILES
THAT
MAY
BE
ACCESSED
CONCURRENTLY
BY
MULTIPLE
USERS
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
ADD
FILE
LOCKING
TO
THEM
AS
IN
EXAMPLE
WHICH
IS
AN
UPDATED
VERSION
OF

SUCCESSFULLY

THERE
IS
A
TRICK
TO
FILE
LOCKING
TO
PRESERVE
THE
BEST
POSSIBLE
RESPONSE
TIME
FOR
YOUR
WEBSITE
VISITORS
PERFORM
IT
DIRECTLY
BEFORE
A
CHANGE
YOU
MAKE
TO
A
FILE
AND
THEN
UNLOCK
IT
IM
MEDIATELY
AFTERWARD
HAVING
A
FILE
LOCKED
FOR
ANY
LONGER
THAN
THIS
WILL
SLOW
DOWN
YOUR
APPLICATION
UNNECESSARILY
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
CALLS
TO
FLOCK
IN
EXAMPLE
ARE
DIRECTLY
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
THE
FWRITE
CALL
THE
FIRST
CALL
TO
FLOCK
SETS
AN
EXCLUSIVE
FILE
LOCK
ON
THE
FILE
REFERRED
TO
BY
FH
USING
THE
PARAMETER
FLOCK
FH
FROM
THIS
POINT
ONWARD
NO
OTHER
PROCESSES
CAN
WRITE
TO
OR
EVEN
READ
FROM
THE
FILE
UNTIL
YOU
RELEASE
THE
LOCK
BY
USING
THE
PARAMETER
LIKE
THIS
FLOCK
FH
AS
SOON
AS
THE
LOCK
IS
RELEASED
OTHER
PROCESSES
ARE
AGAIN
ALLOWED
ACCESS
TO
THE
FILE
THIS
IS
ONE
REASON
WHY
YOU
SHOULD
RESEEK
TO
THE
POINT
YOU
WISH
TO
ACCESS
IN
A
FILE
EACH
TIME
YOU
NEED
TO
READ
OR
WRITE
DATA
BECAUSE
ANOTHER
PROCESS
COULD
HAVE
CHANGED
THE
FILE
SINCE
THE
LAST
ACCESS
HOWEVER
DID
YOU
NOTICE
THAT
THE
CALL
TO
REQUEST
AN
EXCLUSIVE
LOCK
IS
NESTED
AS
PART
OF
AN
IF
STATEMENT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
FLOCK
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
ON
ALL
SYSTEMS
THUS
IT
IS
WISE
TO
CHECK
WHETHER
YOU
SUCCESSFULLY
SECURED
A
LOCK
JUST
IN
CASE
ONE
COULD
NOT
BE
OBTAINED
SOMETHING
ELSE
YOU
MUST
CONSIDER
IS
THAT
FLOCK
IS
WHAT
IS
KNOWN
AS
AN
ADVISORY
LOCK
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IT
LOCKS
OUT
ONLY
OTHER
PROCESSES
THAT
CALL
THE
FUNCTION
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
CODE
THAT
GOES
RIGHT
IN
AND
MODIFIES
FILES
WITHOUT
IMPLEMENTING
FLOCK
FILE
LOCKING
IT
WILL
ALWAYS
OVERRIDE
THE
LOCKING
AND
COULD
WREAK
HAVOC
ON
YOUR
FILES
BY
THE
WAY
IMPLEMENTING
FILE
LOCKING
AND
THEN
ACCIDENTALLY
LEAVING
IT
OUT
IN
ONE
SECTION
OF
CODE
CAN
LEAD
TO
AN
EXTREMELY
HARD
TO
LOCATE
BUG
FLOCK
WILL
NOT
WORK
ON
NFS
AND
MANY
OTHER
NETWORKED
FILESYSTEMS
ALSO
WHEN
USING
A
MULTITHREADED
SERVER
LIKE
ISAPI
YOU
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
RELY
ON
FLOCK
TO
PROTECT
FILES
AGAINST
OTHER
PHP
SCRIPTS
RUN
NING
IN
PARALLEL
THREADS
OF
THE
SAME
SERVER
INSTANCE
ADDITIONALLY
FLOCK
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
ON
ANY
SYSTEM
USING
THE
OLD
FAT
FILESYSTEM
SUCH
AS
OLDER
VERSIONS
OF
WINDOWS
READING
AN
ENTIRE
FILE
A
HANDY
FUNCTION
FOR
READING
IN
AN
ENTIRE
FILE
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
USE
FILE
HANDLES
IS
IT
VERY
EASY
TO
USE
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
IN
EXAMPLE
EXAMPLE
USING
PHP
ECHO
PRE
ENABLES

BUT
THE
FUNCTION
IS
ACTUALLY
A
LOT
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
THAT
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
ALSO
USE
IT
TO
FETCH
A
FILE
FROM
A
SERVER
ACROSS
THE
INTERNET
AS
IN
EXAMPLE
WHICH
REQUESTS
THE
HTML
FROM
THE
O
REILLY

AND
THEN
DISPLAYS
IT
AS
IF
THE

THE

WILL
BE

IT
ACTUALLY
COULDN
T
BE
MUCH
EASIER
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
TO

A

FROM
A

IS
CHOOSE
A

THE

IT

AN

OF

A
NAME
OF

AND
AN

WITH
A

THE
SECOND

IS
JUST
A

WHICH

THE

OF

AND
THEN
THE

IS

THIS
SHORT
PROGRAM
SHOWS
A
COMMON
TECHNIQUE
IN
WEB
PROGRAMMING
IN
WHICH
A
SINGLE
PROGRAM
IS
CALLED
TWICE
ONCE
WHEN
THE
USER
FIRST
VISITS
A
PAGE
AND
AGAIN
WHEN
THE
USER
PRESSES
THE
SUBMIT
BUTTON
THE
PHP
CODE
TO
RECEIVE
THE
UPLOADED
DATA
IS
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
BECAUSE
ALL
UPLOADED
FILES
ARE
PLACED
INTO
THE
ASSOCIATIVE
SYSTEM
ARRAY
THEREFORE
A
QUICK
CHECK
TO
SEE
WHETHER
CONTAINS
ANYTHING
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THE
USER
HAS
UP
LOADED
A
FILE
THIS
IS
DONE
WITH
THE
STATEMENT
IF
THE
FIRST
TIME
THE
USER
VISITS
THE

BEFORE
UPLOADING
A
FILE
IS
EMPTY
SO
THE
PROGRAM
SKIPS
THIS
BLOCK
OF
CODE
WHEN
THE
USER
UPLOADS
A
FILE
THE
PROGRAM
RUNS
AGAIN
AND
DISCOVERS
AN
ELEMENT
IN

ONCE
THE

REALIZES
THAT
A

THE

AS

IS
RETRIEVED
AND

NOW
ALL
THAT

IS
TO

IN
WHICH

THAT
WAY
NO
ATTEMPTS

IF
THIS
MEANS
THAT
MORE

COULD
END

HAVING
A

UPLOADED
WITH

YOU
COULD
PREFIX
SUCH
FILES
WITH
THEIR

NAME
OR
SAVE
THEM
TO
INDIVIDUALLY
CREATED
FOLDERS
FOR
EACH

BUT
IF
YOU
MUST
USE
A

YOU
SHOULD
SANITIZE
IT
BY
ALLOWING
ONLY

THE

SO
FOR

YOU

THE

NOW
THAT
YOU
VE

HOW
EASY
IT
IS
TO
USE

AND
CREATED
YOUR

IT

LOOK
AT
HOW
YOU
CREATE

AS
YOU
PROBABLY
WON
T
WANT

IT
COULD
CAUSE
A

SHOULD
YOU

THIS

IS
VERY
USEFUL
AS
MYSQL
CAN
THEN
PLAN
THE
SIZE
OF
DATABASES
AND
PERFORM
LOOKUPS
AND

MORE
EASILY
THE
DOWNSIDE
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
EVER
ATTEMPT
TO
ASSIGN
A

VALUE
LONGER
THAN
THE
LENGTH
ALLOWED
IT
WILL
BE
TRUNCATED
TO
THE
MAXIMUM
LENGTH
DECLARED
IN
THE

DEFINITION
THE

FIELD
HOWEVER
HAS
MORE
PREDICTABLE
VALUES
SO
INSTEAD
OF

WE
USE
THE
MORE
EFFICIENT
CHAR
DATA
TYPE
THE
PARAMETER
OF
ALLOWS
FOR
FOUR
BYTES
OF

SUPPORTING
ALL
YEARS
FROM
TO
A
BYTE
COMPRISES
BITS
AND
CAN
HAVE
THE
VALUES
THROUGH
WHICH
ARE
TO
IN
DECIMAL
YOU
COULD
OF
COURSE
JUST
STORE
TWO
DIGIT
VALUES
FOR
THE
YEAR
BUT
IF
YOUR
DATA
IS
GOING
TO
STILL
BE
NEEDED
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
CENTURY
OR
MAY
OTHERWISE
WRAP
AROUND
IT
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
SANITIZED
FIRST
MUCH
LIKE
THE
MILLENNIUM
BUG
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
CAUSED
DATES
BE
GINNING
ON
JANUARY
TO
BE
TREATED
AS
ON
MANY
OF
THE
WORLD
BIGGEST
COM
PUTER
INSTALLATIONS
THE
REASON
I
DIDN
T
USE
THE
YEAR
DATA
TYPE
IN
THE
CLASSICS
TABLE
IS
BECAUSE
IT
SUPPORTS
ONLY
THE
YEAR
AND
YEARS
THROUGH
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
MYSQL
STORES
THE
YEAR
IN
A
SINGLE
BYTE
FOR
REASONS
OF
EFFI
CIENCY
BUT
IT
ALSO
MEANS
THAT
ONLY
YEARS
ARE
AVAILABLE
AND
THE
PUBLICATION
YEARS
OF
THE
TITLES
IN
THE
CLASSICS
TABLE
ARE
WELL
BEFORE
THIS
BOTH
CHAR
AND
VARCHAR
ACCEPT
TEXT
STRINGS
AND
IMPOSE
A
LIMIT
ON
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
FIELD
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
EVERY
STRING
IN
A
CHAR
FIELD
HAS
THE
SPECIFIED
SIZE
IF
YOU
PUT
IN
A
SMALLER
STRING
IT
IS
PADDED
WITH
SPACES
A
VARCHAR
FIELD
DOES
NOT
PAD
THE
TEXT
IT
LETS
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
FIELD
VARY
TO
FIT
THE
TEXT
THAT
IS
INSERTED
BUT
VARCHAR
REQUIRES
A
SMALL
AMOUNT
OF
OVERHEAD
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
THE
SIZE
OF
EACH
VALUE
SO
CHAR
IS
SLIGHTLY
MORE
EFFICIENT
IF
THE
SIZES
ARE
SIMILAR
IN
ALL
RECORDS
WHEREAS
VARCHAR
IS
MORE
EFFICIENT
IF
SIZES
CAN
VARY
A
LOT
AND
GET
LARGE
IN
ADDITION
THE
OVERHEAD
CAUSES
ACCESS
TO

DATA
TO
BE
SLIGHTLY
SLOWER

TO

YOU
COULD
DO
THIS
IN

BY
CAREFULLY

YOU

MAKING
SURE
THAT
THERE
IS
AT
LEAST
ONE

THAT
DIFFERS

THIS
APPROACH
IS
ERROR
PRONE
AND
WORKS
ONLY
IN

CIRCUMSTANCES

AN

SO

BE

INTRODUCE
THE

A

THIS

YOUR
INTRODUCTION

WHICH
IS
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THE

ALTER
OPERATES
ON

OUR
EXAMPLE
ADDS
A
COLUMN
NAMED
ID
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
CHARACTERISTICS
INT
UNSIGNED
MAKES
THE
COLUMN
TAKE
AN
INTEGER
LARGE
ENOUGH
FOR
YOU
TO
STORE
MORE
THAN
BILLION
RECORDS
IN
THE

NOT
NULL
ENSURES
THAT
EVERY

HAS
A
VALUE
MANY
PROGRAMMERS
USE
NULL
IN
A
FIELD
TO
INDICATE
THAT
THE
FIELD
DOESN
T
HAVE
ANY
VALUE
BUT
THAT
WOULD
ALLOW
DUPLICATES
WHICH
WOULD
VIOLATE
THE
WHOLE
REASON
FOR
THIS
COLUMN
EXISTENCE
SO
WE
DISALLOW
NULL
VALUES
CAUSES
MYSQL

A
UNIQUE

OVER
THE

ALL
WE
CARE
ABOUT
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
GUARANTEED
A
UNIQUE

AN

USEFUL

RENAMING
A

LOOKING
AGAIN
AT

YOU
MAY
DECIDE
THAT
HAVING
A

NAMED

CAN
BE
CONFUSING
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
NAME
USED
BY

TO
IDENTIFY

AGAIN
NO

LET
CHANGE

TO

LIKE
THIS
ALTER

VARCHAR
NOTE
THE
ADDITION
OF

ON
THE

THAT
BECAUSE
THE

REQUIRES
THE

TO
BE
SPECIFIED
EVEN
IF
YOU
DON
T
INTEND

THE

SO
HERE
HOW
TO
REMOVE
THAT

USING
THE
DROP
KEYWORD
ALTER

CLASSICS
DROP
PAGES
REMEMBER
THAT
DROP
IS
IRREVERSIBLE
AND
YOU
SHOULD
ALWAYS
USE
IT
WITH
CAUTION
BECAUSE
YOU
COULD
INADVERTENTLY
DELETE
ENTIRE
TABLES
AND
EVEN
DATABASES
WITH
IT
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT
CAREFUL
DELETING
A
TABLE
DELETING
A

IS
VERY
EASY
INDEED
BUT
BECAUSE
I
DON
T
WANT
YOU
TO
HAVE
TO
REENTER
ALL
THE
DATA
FOR
THE
CLASSICS
TABLE
LET
QUICKLY
CREATE
A
NEW

VERIFY
ITS
EXISTENCE
AND
THEN
DELETE
IT
BY
TYPING
THE

THE

OF

UNTIL
IT
GROWS
TO
MORE
THAN
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
ROWS
THAT
IS
AT
THAT
POINT
DATABASE
ACCESSES
WILL
GET
SLOWER
AND
SLOWER
WITH
EVERY
NEW
ROW
ADDED
BECAUSE
MYSQL
HAS
TO
SEARCH
THROUGH
EVERY
ROW
WHENEVER
A
QUERY
IS
ISSUED
THIS
IS
LIKE
SEARCHING
THROUGH
EVERY
BOOK
IN
A
LIBRARY
WHENEVER
YOU
NEED
TO
LOOK
SOMETHING
UP
OF
COURSE
YOU
DON
T
HAVE
TO
SEARCH
LIBRARIES
THAT
WAY
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
EITHER
A
CARD
INDEX
SYSTEM
OR
MOST
LIKELY
A
DATABASE
OF
THEIR
OWN
AND
THE
SAME
GOES
FOR
MYSQL
BECAUSE
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
A
SLIGHT
OVERHEAD
IN
MEMORY
AND
DISK
SPACE
YOU
CAN
CREATE
A
CARD
INDEX
FOR
A
TABLE
THAT
MYSQL
WILL
USE
TO
CONDUCT
LIGHTNING
FAST
SEARCHES
CREATING
AN
INDEX
THE
WAY
TO
ACHIEVE
FAST
SEARCHES
IS
TO
ADD
AN
INDEX
EITHER
WHEN
CREATING
A
TABLE
OR
AT
ANY
TIME
AFTERWARD
BUT
THE
DECISION
IS
NOT
SO
SIMPLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENT
INDEX
TYPES
SUCH
AS
A
REGULAR
INDEX
PRIMARY
KEY
AND
FULLTEXT
ALSO
YOU
MUST
DECIDE
WHICH
COLUMNS
REQUIRE
AN
INDEX
A
JUDGMENT
THAT
REQUIRES
YOU
TO
PREDICT
WHETHER
YOU
WILL
BE
SEARCHING
ANY
OF
THE
DATA
IN
THAT
COLUMN
INDEXES
CAN
ALSO
GET
COMPLICATED
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
COMBINE
MULTIPLE
COLUMNS
IN
ONE
INDEX
AND
EVEN
WHEN
YOU
VE
DECIDED
THAT
YOU
STILL
HAVE
THE
OPTION
OF
REDUCING
INDEX
SIZE
BY
LIMITING
THE
AMOUNT
OF
EACH
COLUMN
TO
BE
INDEXED
IF
WE
IMAGINE
THE
SEARCHES
THAT
MAY
BE
MADE
ON
THE

IT
BECOMES
APPARENT
THAT
ALL
OF
THE

MAY

TO
BE
SEARCHED
HOWEVER
IF
THE

CREATED
IN
THE

ADDING
A

ON

HAD
NOT
BEEN
DELETED
IT
WOULD
PROB
ABLY
NOT

AS
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
UNLIKELY
TO

IN

I
GIVE
YOU
A
FEW
TIPS
SO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
TO
LOOK
FOR

A
MYSQL

SO
FAR
WE
VE
CREATED
A
MYSQL
DATABASE
AND
TABLES
POPULATED
THEM
WITH
DATA
AND
ADDED
INDEXES
TO
MAKE
THEM
FAST
TO

NOW
IT
TIME
TO
LOOK
AT
HOW
THESE
SEARCHES
ARE
PERFORMED
AND
THE
VARIOUS
COMMANDS
AND
QUALIFIERS
AVAILABLE
SELECT
AS
YOU
SAW
IN

THE
SELECT
COMMAND
IS
USED
TO
EXTRACT
DATA
FROM
A

IN
THAT
SECTION
I
USED
ITS
SIMPLEST
FORM
TO
SELECT
ALL
DATA
AND
DISPLAY
IT
SOMETHING
YOU
WILL
NEVER
WANT
TO
DO
ON
ANYTHING
BUT
THE
SMALLEST
TABLES
BECAUSE
ALL
THE
DATA
WILL
SCROLL
BY
AT
AN
UNREADABLE
PACE
LET
NOW
EXAMINE
SELECT
IN
MORE
DETAIL
THE
BASIC
SYNTAX
IS
SELECT
SOMETHING
FROM
TABLENAME
THE
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
AN
ASTERISK
AS
YOU
SAW
BEFORE
WHICH
MEANS
EVERY
COLUMN
OR
YOU
CAN
CHOOSE
TO
SELECT
ONLY
CERTAIN
COLUMNS
FOR
INSTANCE
EXAMPLE
SHOWS
HOW
TO
SELECT
JUST
THE
AUTHOR

AND
JUST

THE
RESULT

YOU

WE
NOW
NEED

FOR

HOW
DO
YOU
DECIDE
WHAT

TO
PLACE
IN

WELL
OVER
THE

A

HAVE
BEEN

BE
EFFICIENT
AND

OF

MORE

DESIGN
IT
VERY
IMPORTANT
THAT
YOU
DESIGN
A

CORRECTLY
BEFORE
YOU
START
TO
CREATE
IT
OTHERWISE
YOU
ARE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
GO
BACK

CHANGE
IT
BY
SPLITTING
UP
SOME

ARE
LIKELY
TO

IS
AN
EXCELLENT
STARTING
POINT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AN
ONLINE

DATABASE
SOME
OF
YOUR
QUESTIONS
COULD
BE
HOW
MANY
AUTHORS
BOOKS
AND
CUSTOMERS
ARE
IN
THE
DATABASE
WHICH
AUTHOR
WROTE
A
CERTAIN
BOOK
WHICH
BOOKS
WERE
WRITTEN
BY
A

WHAT
IS
THE
MOST
EXPENSIVE

WHAT
IS
THE

HAVE
NOT

THIS

WHICH
BOOKS
DID
A
CERTAIN

BUY
WHICH

HAVE
BEEN
PURCHASED
TOGETHER
OF

THERE
ARE
MANY
MORE
QUERIES
THAT
YOU
COULD
MAKE
ON
SUCH
A
DATABASE
BUT
EVEN
THIS
SMALL
SAMPLE
WILL
BEGIN
TO
GIVE
YOU
INSIGHTS
INTO
HOW
TO
LAY
OUT
YOUR
TABLES
FOR
EXAMPLE
BOOKS
AND
ISBNS
CAN
PROBABLY
BE
COMBINED
INTO
ONE
TABLE
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
CLOSELY
LINKED
WE
LL
EXAMINE
SOME
OF
THE
SUBTLETIES
LATER
IN
CONTRAST
BOOKS
AND
CUSTOMERS
SHOULD
BE
IN
SEPARATE
TABLES
BECAUSE
THEIR
CONNECTION
IS
VERY
LOOSE
A
CUS
TOMER
CAN
BUY
ANY
BOOK
AND
EVEN
MULTIPLE
COPIES
OF
A

YET
A
BOOK
CAN
BE
BOUGHT
BY
MANY
CUSTOMERS
AND
BE
IGNORED
BY
STILL
MORE
POTENTIAL
CUSTOMERS
WHEN
YOU
PLAN
TO
DO
A
LOT
OF
SEARCHES
ON
SOMETHING
IT
CAN
OFTEN
BENEFIT
BY
HAVING
ITS
OWN
TABLE
AND
WHEN
COUPLINGS
BETWEEN
THINGS
ARE
LOOSE
IT
BEST
TO
PUT
THEM
IN
SEPARATE
TABLES
TAKING
INTO
ACCOUNT
THOSE
SIMPLE
RULES
OF
THUMB
WE
CAN
GUESS
WE
LL
NEED
AT
LEAST
THREE
TABLES
TO
ACCOMMODATE
ALL
THESE
QUERIES
AUTHORS
THERE
WILL
BE
LOTS
OF
SEARCHES
FOR

MANY
OF
WHOM
HAVE
COLLABORATED

MANY

WHOM
WILL
BE

SO
THE

ARE
COMPLICATED

AROUND
SOME
OBJECT
THAT
YOU
RE
LIKELY

AN

IN

THE
ISBN
IS
A
RARE
CASE
FOR
WHICH
AN
INDUSTRY
HAS
PROVIDED
A
PRIMARY
KEY
THAT
YOU
CAN
RELY
ON
TO
BE
UNIQUE
FOR
EACH
PRODUCT
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
YOU
LL
CREATE
AN
ARBITRARY
KEY
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
USING
NORMALIZATION
THE
PROCESS
OF
SEPARATING
YOUR
DATA
INTO
TABLES
AND
CREATING
PRIMARY
KEYS
IS
CALLED
NORMALIZATION
ITS
MAIN
GOAL
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
EACH
PIECE
OF
INFORMATION
APPEARS
IN
THE
DATABASE
ONLY
ONCE
DUPLICATING
DATA
IS
VERY
INEFFICIENT
BECAUSE
IT
MAKES
DATABASES
LARGER
THAN
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
AND
THEREFORE
SLOWS
DOWN
ACCESS
BUT
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
DUPLICATES
CREATES
A
STRONG
RISK
THAT
YOU
LL
UPDATE
ONLY
ONE
ROW
OF
DUPLICATED
DATA
CREATING
INCONSISTENCIES
IN
A
DATABASE
AND
POTENTIALLY
CAUSING
SERIOUS
ERRORS
THUS
IF
YOU
LIST
THE
TITLES
OF
BOOKS
IN
THE
AUTHORS
TABLE
AS
WELL
AS
THE
BOOKS
TABLE
AND
YOU
HAVE
TO
CORRECT
A
TYPOGRAPHIC
ERROR
IN
A
TITLE
YOU
LL
HAVE
TO
SEARCH
THROUGH
BOTH
TABLES
AND
MAKE
SURE
YOU
MAKE
THE
SAME
CHANGE
EVERY
PLACE
THE
TITLE
IS
LISTED
IT
BETTER
TO
KEEP
THE
TITLE
IN
ONE
PLACE
AND
USE
THE
ISBN
IN
OTHER
PLACES
BUT
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
SPLITTING
A
DATABASE
INTO
MULTIPLE
TABLES
IT
IMPORTANT
NOT
TO
GO
TOO
FAR
AND
CREATE
MORE
TABLES
THAN
IS
NECESSARY
WHICH
WOULD
ALSO
LEAD
TO
INEFFICIENT
DESIGN
AND
SLOWER
ACCESS
LUCKILY
E
F
CODD
THE
INVENTOR
OF
THE
RELATIONAL
MODEL
ANALYZED
THE
CONCEPT
OF
NOR
MALIZATION
AND
SPLIT
IT
INTO
THREE
SEPARATE
SCHEMAS
CALLED
FIRST
SECOND
AND
THIRD
NORMAL
FORM
IF
YOU
MODIFY
A
DATABASE
TO
SATISFY
EACH
OF
THESE
FORMS
IN
ORDER
YOU
WILL
ENSURE
THAT
YOUR
DATABASE
IS
OPTIMALLY
BALANCED
FOR
FAST
ACCESS
AND
MINIMUM
MEMORY
AND
DISK
SPACE
USAGE
TO
SEE
HOW
THE
NORMALIZATION
PROCESS
WORKS
LET
START
WITH
THE
RATHER
MONSTROUS
DATABASE
IN

WHICH
SHOWS
A
SINGLE
TABLE
CONTAINING
ALL

THE

YOU
COULD
CONSIDER
IT
A
FIRST
ATTEMPT
AT
A
TABLE
INTENDED
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
WHICH
CUSTOMERS
HAVE
ORDERED
BOOKS
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
IS
INEFFICIENT
DESIGN
BECAUSE
DATA
IS
DUPLICATED
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
DUPLICATIONS
ARE
HIGH
LIGHTED

IT
REPRESENTS

AND

THE

FOR

WHEN
WE
GET
AROUND
TO
CREATING
THAT

I
MENTION
THAT
HERE
IN
ORDER
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
THE
ISBN
IS
NOT
HOWEVER
THE
PRIMARY

FOR
THE

TABLE
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
THE

WOULD
DESERVE
A
PRIMARY

TOO
SO
THAT
EACH

WOULD
HAVE
A
KEY
TO
UNIQUELY
IDENTIFY
HIM
OR

SO
IN

TABLE
THE

IS
JUST
A
COLUMN
FOR
WHICH
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
SPEEDING
UP

WE
LL
PROBABLY
MAKE
A
KEY
BUT
NOT
THE
PRIMARY
KEY
IN
FACT
IT
CANNOT
BE
THE
PRIMARY

IN
THIS

BECAUSE
IT
NOT
UNIQUE
THE
SAME
ISBN
APPEARS
MULTIPLE
TIMES
WHENEVER
TWO
OR
MORE
AUTHORS
HAVE
COLLABORATED
ON
A
BOOK
BECAUSE
WE
LL
USE
IT
TO

IN
ANOTHER
TABLE
THIS
COLUMN
IS
CALLED
A
FOREIGN
KEY
KEYS
ALSO
CALLED
INDEXES
HAVE
SEVERAL
PURPOSES
IN

THE
FUN
DAMENTAL
REASON
FOR
DEFINING
A
KEY
IS
TO
MAKE
SEARCHES
FASTER
YOU
VE
SEEN
EXAMPLES
IN
CHAPTER
IN
WHICH
KEYS
ARE
USED
IN
WHERE
CLAUSES
FOR

BUT
A
KEY
CAN
ALSO
BE
USEFUL
TO
UNIQUELY
IDENTIFY
AN

THUS
A
UNIQUE
KEY
IS
OFTEN
USED
AS
A
PRIMARY

IN

AND
AS
A

TO

IN

TABLE
SECOND

THE
FIRST
NORMAL

WITH

MULTIPLE

UMNS
THE
SECOND
NORMAL

IS
ALL
ABOUT
REDUNDANCY
ACROSS
MULTIPLE

IN
ORDER
TO
ACHIEVE
SECOND
NORMAL
FORM
YOUR
TABLES
MUST
ALREADY
BE
IN
FIRST
NORMAL

ONCE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
DONE
WE
ACHIEVE
SECOND
NORMAL
FORM
BY
IDENTIFYING
COLUMNS
WHOSE
DATA
REPEATS
IN
DIFFERENT
PLACES
AND
THEN
REMOVING
THEM
TO
THEIR
OWN
TABLES
SO
LET
LOOK
AGAIN
AT
TABLE
NOTICE
HOW
DARREN
RYDER
BOUGHT
TWO
BOOKS
AND
THEREFORE
HIS
DETAILS
ARE
DUPLICATED
THIS
TELLS
US
THAT
THE
CUSTOMER
COLUMNS
NEED
TO
BE
PULLED
INTO
THEIR
OWN

AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
ALL
THAT
LEFT
IN

ARE
THE

COLUMNS
FOR
FOUR
UNIQUE

SO
THIS
NOW
CONSTITUTES
AN
EFFICIENT
AND
SELF
CONTAINED
TABLE
THAT
SATISFIES
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
BOTH
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
NORMAL

ALONG
THE
WAY
WE
VE
MANAGED
TO
REDUCE
THE

THIS

COULD
ALSO
INCLUDE

OF

PAGE
COUNTS
NUMBERS
OF

AND
SO
ON
AS
THESE

ARE
ALSO

THE
ONLY
RULE
IS
THAT
WE
CAN
T
PUT
IN
ANY
COLUMN
THAT
COULD
HAVE
MULTIPLE
VALUES
FOR
A
SINGLE
BOOK
BECAUSE
THEN
WE
D
HAVE

AND
WOULD
THUS
VIOLATE

RESTORING
AN

WOULD

THIS
NORMALIZATION
HOWEVER
LOOKING
AT
THE

NOW
IN

WE
CAN
SEE
THAT
THERE
STILL
MORE

TO
DO
BECAUSE

WHAT

THE

THE

THE

YOU
MIGHT

HOWEVER
IF

TO
BE

STRICT
WITH

YOU
CAN
ENSURE
THAT
IT

THAT

THAT

IN
THE

ALSO
BE

ACCORDING

TABLE
IT
COULD
BE
ARGUED
THAT

THEREFORE

ALL
THAT
YOU
WILL
EVER
REQUIRE
YOU
PROBABLY
WILL
WANT
TO
LEAVE
OUT
THIS
FINAL
NORMALIZATION
STAGE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
SUPPOSE
YOU
ARE
WRITING
A
DATABASE
FOR
A
LARGE
ORGANIZATION
SUCH
AS
THE
U
POSTAL
SERVICE
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
IF
A
CITY
WERE
TO
BE
RENAMED
WITH
A
TABLE
SUCH
AS
TABLE
YOU
WOULD
NEED
TO
PERFORM
A
GLOBAL
SEARCH
AND
REPLACE
ON
EVERY
INSTANCE
OF
THAT
CITY
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
YOUR
DATABASE
SET
UP
ACCORDING
TO
THE
THIRD
NORMAL
FORM
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
CHANGE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
ENTRY
IN
TABLE
FOR
THE
CHANGE
TO
BE
REFLECTED
THROUGHOUT
THE
ENTIRE
DATABASE
THEREFORE
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
ASK
YOURSELF
TWO
QUESTIONS
TO
HELP
YOU
DECIDE
WHETHER
TO
PERFORM
A
THIRD
NORMAL
FORM
NORMALIZATION
ON
ANY
TABLE
IS
IT
LIKELY
THAT
MANY
NEW
COLUMNS
WILL
NEED
TO
BE
ADDED
TO
THIS
TABLE
COULD
ANY
OF
THIS
TABLE
FIELDS
REQUIRE
A
GLOBAL
UPDATE
AT
ANY
POINT
IF
EITHER
OF
THE
ANSWERS
IS
YES
YOU
SHOULD
PROBABLY
CONSIDER
PERFORMING
THIS
FINAL
STAGE
OF
NORMALIZATION
WHEN
NOT
TO
USE
NORMALIZATION
NOW
THAT
YOU
KNOW
ALL
ABOUT
NORMALIZATION
I
M
GOING
TO
TELL
YOU
WHY
YOU
SHOULD
THROW
THESE
RULES
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
ON
HIGH
TRAFFIC
SITES
THAT
RIGHT
YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
FULLY
NORMALIZE
YOUR
TABLES
ON
SITES
THAT
WILL
CAUSE
MYSQL
TO
THRASH
NORMALIZATION
REQUIRES
SPREADING
DATA
ACROSS
MULTIPLE
TABLES
AND
THIS
MEANS
MAKING
MULTIPLE
CALLS
TO
MYSQL
FOR
EACH
QUERY
ON
A
VERY
POPULAR
SITE
IF
YOU
HAVE
NORMALIZED
TABLES
YOUR
DATABASE
ACCESS
WILL
SLOW
DOWN
CONSIDERABLY
ONCE
YOU
GET
ABOVE
A
FEW
DOZEN
CONCURRENT
USERS
BECAUSE
THEY
WILL
BE
CREATING
HUNDREDS
OF
DATABASE
ACCESSES
BETWEEN
THEM
IN
FACT
I
WOULD
GO
SO
FAR
AS
TO
SAY
YOU
SHOULD
DENORMALIZE
ANY
COMMONLY
LOOKED
UP
DATA
AS
MUCH
AS
YOU
CAN
YOU
SEE
IF
YOU
HAVE
DATA
DUPLICATED
ACROSS
YOUR
TABLES
YOU
CAN
SUBSTANTIALLY
REDUCE
THE
NUMBER
OF
ADDITIONAL
REQUESTS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
MADE
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THE
DATA
YOU
WANT
IS
AVAILABLE
IN
EACH
TABLE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
YOU
CAN
SIMPLY
ADD
AN
EXTRA
COLUMN
TO
A
QUERY
AND
THAT
FIELD
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
ALL
MATCHING
RESULTS
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
DOWNSIDES
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
SUCH
AS
USING
UP
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
DISK
SPACE
AND
ENSURING
THAT
YOU
UPDATE
EVERY
SINGLE
DUPLICATE
COPY
OF
DATA
WHEN
ONE
OF
THEM
NEEDS
MODIFYING
MULTIPLE
UPDATES
CAN
BE
COMPUTERIZED
THOUGH
MYSQL
PROVIDES
A
FEATURE
CALLED
TRIG
GERS
THAT
MAKE
AUTOMATIC
CHANGES
TO
THE
DATABASE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
CHANGES
YOU
MAKE
TRIGGERS
ARE
HOWEVER
BEYOND
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
BOOK
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
PROPAGATE
RE
DUNDANT
DATA
IS
TO
SET
UP
A
PHP
PROGRAM
TO
RUN
REGULARLY
AND
KEEP
ALL
COPIES
IN
SYNC
THE
PROGRAM
READS
CHANGES
FROM
A
MASTER
TABLE
AND
UPDATES
ALL
THE
OTHERS
YOU
LL
SEE
HOW
TO
ACCESS
MYSQL
FROM
PHP
IN
THE
NEXT
CHAPTER
HOWEVER
UNTIL
YOU
ARE
VERY
EXPERIENCED
WITH
MYSQL
I
RECOMMEND
THAT
YOU
FULLY
NORMALIZE
ALL
YOUR
TABLES
AT
LEAST
TO
FIRST
AND
SECOND
NORMAL
FORM
AS
THIS
WILL
INSTILL
THE
HABIT
AND
PUT
YOU
IN
GOOD
STEAD
ONLY
WHEN
YOU
ACTUALLY
START
TO
SEE
MYSQL
LOGJAMS
SHOULD
YOU
CONSIDER
LOOKING
AT
DENORMALIZATION
RELATIONSHIPS
MYSQL
IS
CALLED
A
RELATIONAL
DATABASE
MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM
BECAUSE
ITS
TABLES
STORE
NOT
ONLY
DATA
BUT
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
AMONG
THE
DATA
THERE
ARE
THREE
CATEGORIES
OF
RELATION
SHIPS
ONE
TO
ONE
A
ONE
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIP
IS
LIKE
A
TRADITIONAL
MARRIAGE
EACH
ITEM
HAS
A
RELATIONSHIP
TO
ONLY
ONE
ITEM
OF
THE
OTHER
TYPE
THIS
IS
SURPRISINGLY
RARE
FOR
INSTANCE
AN
AUTHOR
CAN
WRITE
MULTIPLE
BOOKS
A
BOOK
CAN
HAVE
MULTIPLE
AUTHORS
AND
EVEN
AN
ADDRESS
CAN
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MULTIPLE
CUSTOMERS
PERHAPS
THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
SO
FAR
OF
A
ONE
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIP
IS
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
NAME
OF
A
STATE
AND
ITS
TWO
CHARACTER
ABBREVIATION
HOWEVER
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
LET
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
CAN
ONLY
EVER
BE
ONE
CUSTOMER
AT
ANY
ADDRESS
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
THE
CUSTOMERS
ADDRESSES
RELATIONSHIP
IN
FIGURE
IS
A
ONE
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIP
ONLY
ONE
CUSTOMER
LIVES
AT
EACH
ADDRESS
AND
EACH
ADDRESS
CAN
HAVE
ONLY
ONE
CUSTOMER
FIGURE
THE
CUSTOMERS
TABLE
TABLE
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
TABLES
USUALLY
WHEN
TWO
ITEMS
HAVE
A
ONE
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIP
YOU
JUST
INCLUDE
THEM
AS
COL
UMNS
IN
THE
SAME
TABLE
THERE
ARE
TWO
REASONS
FOR
SPLITTING
THEM
INTO
SEPARATE
TABLES
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
PREPARED
IN
CASE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
CHANGES
LATER
THE
TABLE
HAS
A
LOT
OF
COLUMNS
AND
YOU
THINK
THAT
PERFORMANCE
OR
MAINTENANCE
WOULD
BE
IMPROVED
BY
SPLITTING
IT
OF
COURSE
WHEN
YOU
COME
TO
BUILD
YOUR
OWN
DATABASES
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
CREATE
ONE
TO
MANY
CUSTOMER
ADDRESS
RELATIONSHIPS
ONE
ADDRESS
MANY
CUSTOM
ERS
ONE
TO
MANY
ONE
TO
MANY
OR
MANY
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIPS
OCCUR
WHEN
ONE
ROW
IN
ONE
TABLE
IS
LINKED
TO
MANY
ROWS
IN
ANOTHER
TABLE
YOU
HAVE
ALREADY
SEEN
HOW
TABLE
WOULD
TAKE
ON
A
ONE
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIP
IF
MULTIPLE
CUSTOMERS
WERE
ALLOWED
AT
THE
SAME
ADDRESS
WHICH
IS
WHY
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
SPLIT
UP
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
SO
LOOKING
AT
TABLE
WITHIN
FIGURE
YOU
CAN
SEE
THAT
IT
SHARES
A
ONE
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
TABLE
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
OF
EACH
CUSTOMER
IN
TABLE
HOWEVER
TABLE
THE
PURCHASES
TABLE
CAN
AND
DOES
CONTAIN
MORE
THAN
ONE
PURCHASE
FROM
CUSTOMERS
THEREFORE
ONE
CUSTOMER
HAS
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
MANY
PURCHASES
YOU
CAN
SEE
THESE
TWO
TABLES
ALONGSIDE
EACH
OTHER
IN
FIGURE
WHERE
THE
DASHED
LINES
JOINING
ROWS
IN
EACH
TABLE
START
FROM
A
SINGLE
ROW
IN
THE
LEFTHAND
TABLE
BUT
CAN
CONNECT
TO
MORE
THAN
ONE
ROW
ON
THE
RIGHTHAND
TABLE
THIS
ONE
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIP
IS
ALSO
THE
PREFERRED
SCHEME
TO
USE
WHEN
DESCRIBING
A
MANY
TO
ONE
RELATIONSHIP
IN
WHICH
CASE
YOU
WOULD
NORMALLY
SWAP
THE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
TABLES
TO
VIEW
THEM
AS
A
ONE
TO
MANY
RELATION
SHIP
FIGURE
ILLUSTRATING
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
TWO
TABLES
MANY
TO
MANY
IN
A
MANY
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIP
MANY
ROWS
IN
ONE
TABLE
ARE
LINKED
TO
MANY
ROWS
IN
ANOTHER
TABLE
TO
CREATE
THIS
RELATIONSHIP
ADD
A
THIRD
TABLE
CONTAINING
THE
SAME
KEY
COLUMN
FROM
EACH
OF
THE
OTHER
TABLES
THIS
THIRD
TABLE
CONTAINS
NOTHING
ELSE
AS
ITS
SOLE
PURPOSE
IS
TO
LINK
UP
THE
OTHER
TABLES
TABLE
IS
JUST
SUCH
A
TABLE
IT
WAS
EXTRACTED
FROM
TABLE
THE
PURCHASES
TABLE
BUT
OMITS
THE

IT
CONTAINS
A

ALONG
WITH
THE

NUMBER
OF
EACH

TABLE
AN
INTERMEDIARY
TABLE

ISBN
0596005436
WITH
THIS
INTERMEDIARY
TABLE
IN
PLACE
YOU
CAN
TRAVERSE
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
IN
THE

THROUGH
A
SERIES
OF

YOU
CAN
TAKE
AN
ADDRESS
AS
A
STARTING
POINT
AND
FIND
OUT
THE
AUTHORS
OF
ANY
BOOKS
PURCHASED
BY
THE
CUSTOMER
LIVING
AT
THAT
ADDRESS
FOR
EXAMPLE
LET
SUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
WANT
TO
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
PURCHASES
IN
THE
ZIP
CODE
LOOK
THAT
ZIP
CODE
UP
IN
TABLE
AND
YOU
LL
FIND
THAT
CUSTOMER
NUMBER
HAS
BOUGHT
AT
LEAST
ONE
ITEM
FROM
THE

AT
THIS
POINT
YOU
CAN
USE
TABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
HIS
OR
HER
NAME
OR
USE
THE
NEW
INTERMEDIARY
TABLE
TO
SEE
THE
BOOK
PURCHASED
FROM
HERE
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
TWO
TITLES
WERE
PURCHASED
AND
CAN
FOLLOW
THEM
BACK
TO
TABLE
TO
FIND
THE
TITLES
AND
PRICES
OF
THESE
BOOKS
OR
TO
TABLE
TO
SEE
WHO
THE
AUTHORS
WERE
IF
IT
SEEMS
TO
YOU
THAT
THIS
IS
REALLY
COMBINING
MULTIPLE
ONE
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIPS
THEN
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT
TO
ILLUSTRATE
FIGURE
BRINGS
THREE
TABLES
TOGETHER
FIGURE
CREATING
A
MANY
TO
MANY
RELATIONSHIP
VIA
A
THIRD

FOLLOW
ANY
ZIP

YOU
CAN
LINK
TO
THE
MIDDLE

WHICH
JOINS
THE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
TABLES
BY
LINKING

AND
ISBNS
NOW
ALL
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
FOLLOW
AN
ISBN
OVER
TO
THE
RIGHTHAND
TABLE
TO
SEE
WHICH
BOOK
IT
RELATES
TO
YOU
CAN
ALSO
USE
THE
INTERMEDIARY
TABLE
TO
WORK
YOUR
WAY
BACKWARD
FROM
BOOK
TITLES
TO
ZIP

THE
TITLES
TABLE
CAN
TELL
YOU
THE
ISBN
WHICH
YOU
CAN
USE
IN
THE
MIDDLE

TO
FIND
ID

OF

BOUGHT
THE

AND
FINALLY
THE

TABLE
MATCHES
THE
CUSTOMER
ID
NUMBERS
TO
THE
CUSTOMERS
ZIP

DATABASES
AND
ANONYMITY
AN
INTERESTING
ASPECT
OF
USING
RELATIONS
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
ACCUMULATE
A
LOT
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
SOME
ITEM
SUCH
AS
A
CUSTOMER
WITHOUT
ACTUALLY
KNOWING
WHO
THAT
CUSTOMER
IS
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
EXAMPLE
WE
WENT
FROM
CUSTOMERS
ZIP
CODES
TO
CUSTOMERS
PURCHASES
AND
BACK
AGAIN
WITHOUT
FINDING
OUT
THE
NAME
OF
A
CUSTOMER
DATABASES
CAN
BE
USED
TO
TRACK
PEOPLE
BUT
THEY
CAN
ALSO
BE
USED
TO
HELP
PRESERVE
PEOPLE
PRIVACY
WHILE
STILL
FINDING
USEFUL
INFORMATION
TRANSACTIONS
IN
SOME
APPLICATIONS
IT
IS
VITALLY
IMPORTANT
THAT
A
SEQUENCE
OF
QUERIES
RUNS
IN
THE
CORRECT
ORDER
AND
THAT
EVERY
SINGLE
QUERY
SUCCESSFULLY
COMPLETES
FOR
EXAMPLE
SUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
ARE
CREATING
A
SEQUENCE
OF
QUERIES
TO
TRANSFER

FROM
ONE
BANK
ACCOUNT
TO
ANOTHER
YOU
WOULD
NOT
WANT
EITHER
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
EVENTS
TO
OCCUR
YOU
ADD
THE

BUT
WHEN
YOU
TRY
TO
SUBTRACT

THE

NOW

FAILS
AND
THE

NOW
DISAPPEARED
INTO

AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
NOT
ONLY
IS
THE
ORDER
OF
QUERIES
IMPORTANT
IN
THIS
TYPE
OF
TRANSACTION
BUT
IT
IS
ALSO
VITAL
THAT
ALL
PARTS
OF
THE
TRANSACTION
COMPLETE
SUCCESSFULLY
BUT
HOW
CAN
YOU
ENSURE
THIS
HAPPENS
BECAUSE
SURELY
AFTER
A
QUERY
HAS
OCCURRED
IT
CANNOT
BE
UNDONE
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
ALL
PARTS
OF
A

AND
THEN
UNDO
THEM
ALL
ONE
AT
A
TIME
IF
ANY
ONE
FAILS
THE
ANSWER
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NOT
BECAUSE
MYSQL

ON
AND
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
ADJUST
YOUR
QUERY
OR
THE
DESIGN
OF
YOUR
TABLE
ACCORDINGLY
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
FINISHED
EXPERIMENTING
WITH
THE
TEMPORARY
AC
COUNTS
TABLE
YOU
MAY
WISH
TO
REMOVE
IT
BY
ENTERING
THE
FOLLOWING
COMMAND
DROP
TABLE
ACCOUNTS
BACKING
UP
AND
RESTORING
WHATEVER
KIND
OF
DATA
YOU
ARE
STORING
IN
YOUR
DATABASE
IT
MUST
HAVE
SOME
VALUE
TO
YOU
EVEN
IF
IT
ONLY
THE
COST
OF
THE
TIME
REQUIRED
FOR
REENTERING
IT
SHOULD
THE
HARD
DISK
FAIL
THEREFORE
IT
IMPORTANT
THAT
YOU
KEEP
BACKUPS
TO
PROTECT
YOUR
INVESTMENT
ALSO
THERE
WILL
BE
TIMES
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
MIGRATE
YOUR
DATABASE
OVER
TO
A
NEW
SERVER
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
IS
USUALLY
TO
BACK
IT
UP
FIRST
IT
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
THAT
YOU
TEST
YOUR
BACKUPS
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THEY
ARE
VALID
AND
WILL
WORK
IF
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
USED
THANKFULLY
BACKING
UP
AND
RESTORING
MYSQL
DATA
IS
EASY
WITH
THE
MYSQLDUMP
COMMAND
USING
MYSQLDUMP
WITH
MYSQLDUMP
YOU
CAN
DUMP
A
DATABASE
OR
COLLECTION
OF
DATABASES
INTO
ONE
OR
MORE
FILES
CONTAINING
ALL
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
NECESSARY
TO
RE
CREATE
ALL
YOUR

AND
REPOPULATE
THEM
WITH
YOUR

IT
CAN
ALSO
GENERATE
FILES
IN
CSV
COMMA
SEPARATED
VALUES
AND
OTHER
DELIMITED
TEXT
FORMATS
OR
EVEN
IN
XML
FORMAT
ITS
MAIN
DRAWBACK
IS
THAT
YOU
MUST
MAKE
SURE
THAT
NO
ONE
WRITES
TO
A
TABLE
WHILE
YOU
RE
BACKING
IT
UP
THERE
ARE
VARIOUS
WAYS
TO
DO
THIS
BUT
THE
EASIEST
IS
TO
SHUT
DOWN
THE
MYSQL
SERVER
BEFORE
MYSQLDUMP
AND
START
UP
THE

AGAIN
AFTER

FINISHES
OR
YOU
CAN
LOCK

PLANNING
YOUR

THE
GOLDEN
RULE
TO
BACKING

IS
TO
DO
SO
AS
OFTEN
AS
YOU
FIND
PRACTICAL
THE
MORE
VALUABLE
THE
DATA
THE
MORE
OFTEN
YOU
SHOULD
BACK
IT
UP
AND
THE
MORE
COPIES
YOU
SHOULD
MAKE
IF
YOUR
DATABASE
GETS
UPDATED
AT
LEAST
ONCE
A
DAY
YOU
SHOULD
REALLY
BACK
IT
UP
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
IS
NOT
UPDATED
VERY
OFTEN
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
GET
BY
WITH
LESS
FREQUENT
BACKUPS
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
CONSIDER
MAKING
MULTIPLE
BACKUPS
AND
STORING
THEM
IN
DIFFERENT
LOCATIONS
IF
YOU
HAVE
SEVERAL
SERVERS
IT
IS
A
SIMPLE
MAT
TER
TO
COPY
YOUR
BACKUPS
BETWEEN
THEM
YOU
WOULD
ALSO
BE
WELL
AD
VISED
TO
MAKE
PHYSICAL
BACKUPS
OF
REMOVABLE
HARD
DISKS
THUMB
DRIVES
CDS
OR
DVDS
AND
SO
ON
AND
TO
KEEP
THESE
IN
SEPARATE

TIONS
PREFERABLY
SOMEWHERE

ARE
THE
THREE
RULES
OF
THE

HOW
CAN
YOU
MAKE
A

SATISFY
THE
SECOND
NORMAL
FORM
WHAT
DO
YOU
PUT

ACCESSING

IF
YOU
WORKED
THROUGH
THE
PREVIOUS
CHAPTERS
YOU
RE
PROFICIENT
IN
USING
BOTH
MYSQL
AND

IN
THIS
CHAPTER
YOU
WILL
LEARN
HOW
TO
INTEGRATE
THE
TWO
BY
USING
PHP
BUILT
IN
FUNCTIONS
TO
ACCESS
MYSQL
QUERYING
A
MYSQL
DATABASE
WITH
PHP
THE
REASON
FOR
USING
PHP
AS
AN
INTERFACE
TO
MYSQL
IS
TO
FORMAT
THE
RESULTS
OF
SQL
QUERIES
IN
A
FORM
VISIBLE
IN
A
WEB
PAGE
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
CAN
LOG
INTO
YOUR
MYSQL
INSTAL
LATION
USING
YOUR
USERNAME
AND
PASSWORD
YOU
CAN
ALSO
DO
SO
FROM
PHP
HOWEVER
INSTEAD
OF
USING
MYSQL
COMMAND
LINE
TO
ENTER
INSTRUCTIONS
AND
VIEW
OUTPUT
YOU
WILL
CREATE
QUERY
STRINGS
THAT
ARE
PASSED
TO
MYSQL
WHEN
MYSQL
RETURNS
ITS
RESPONSE
IT
WILL
COME
AS
A
DATA
STRUCTURE
THAT
PHP
CAN
RECOGNIZE
INSTEAD
OF
THE
FORMATTED
OUTPUT
YOU
SEE
WHEN
YOU
WORK
ON
THE
COMMAND
LINE
FURTHER
PHP
COMMANDS
CAN
RETRIEVE
THE
DATA
AND
FORMAT
IT
FOR
THE

PAGE
TO
GET
YOU
STARTED
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
I
USE
THE
STANDARD
PROCEDURAL
MYSQL
FUNCTION

SO
THAT
YOU
LL
BE
UP

RUNNING
QUICKLY
AND
ABLE
TO
MAINTAIN
OLDER
PHP
CODE
HOWEVER
THE
NEW
OBJECT
ORIENTED
MYSQLI
FUNCTIONS
THE
I
STANDS
FOR
IMPROVED
ARE
BECOMING
THE
RECOMMENDED
WAY
TO
INTERFACE
WITH
MYSQL
FROM
PHP
SO
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
CHAPTER
I
LL
SHOW
YOU
HOW
TO
USE
THESE
TOO
OR
INSTEAD
BECAUSE
THE
OLD
FUNCTIONS
HAVE
BECOME
DEPRECATED
AND
COULD
BE
RE
MOVED
FROM
PHP
AT
SOME
POINT
THE
PROCESS
THE
PROCESS
OF
USING
MYSQL
WITH
PHP
IS
CONNECT
TO
MYSQL
SELECT
THE

TO
USE
BUILD
A
QUERY
STRING
PERFORM
THE
QUERY
RETRIEVE
THE
RESULTS
AND
OUTPUT
THEM
TO
A

REPEAT
STEPS
TO
UNTIL
ALL
DESIRED
DATA
HAS
BEEN
RETRIEVED
DISCONNECT
FROM
MYSQL
WE
LL
WORK
THROUGH
THESE
SECTIONS
IN
TURN
BUT
FIRST
IT
IMPORTANT
TO
SET
UP
YOUR
LOGIN
DETAILS
IN
A
SECURE
MANNER
SO
PEOPLE
SNOOPING
AROUND
ON
YOUR
SYSTEM
HAVE
TROUBLE
GETTING
ACCESS
TO
YOUR
DATABASE
CREATING
A
LOGIN
FILE
MOST
WEBSITES
DEVELOPED
WITH
PHP
CONTAIN
MULTIPLE
PROGRAM
FILES
THAT
WILL
REQUIRE
ACCESS
TO
MYSQL
AND
WILL
THUS
NEED
THE
LOGIN
AND
PASSWORD
DETAILS
THEREFORE
IT
SEN
SIBLE
TO
CREATE
A
SINGLE
FILE
TO
STORE
THESE
AND
THEN
INCLUDE
THAT
FILE
WHEREVER
IT
NEEDED
EXAMPLE
SHOWS
SUCH
A

WHICH
I

PHP
TYPE
THE
EXAMPLE
REPLACING
PLACEHOLDER
VALUES
SUCH
AS

WITH
THE
ACTUAL
VALUES
YOU
USE
FOR
YOUR
MYSQL

AND
SAVE
IT
TO
THE
WEB
DEVELOPMENT
DIRECTORY
YOU
SET
UP
IN
CHAPTER
WE
LL
BE
MAKING
USE
OF
THE
FILE
SHORTLY
THE
HOSTNAME
LOCALHOST
SHOULD
WORK
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
RE
USING
A

ON
YOUR

AND
THE

SHOULD
WORK
IF
YOU

EXAMPLE
THE

PHP
LOCALHOST
PUBLICATIONS
USERNAME
PASSWORD
THE
ENCLOSING
PHP
AND
TAGS
ARE
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
FOR
THE
LOGIN
PHP
FILE
IN
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
THEY
MEAN
THAT
THE
LINES
BETWEEN
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
ONLY
AS
PHP
CODE
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
LEAVE
THEM
OUT
AND
SOMEONE
WERE
TO
CALL
UP
THE
FILE
DIRECTLY
FROM
YOUR
WEBSITE
IT
WOULD
DISPLAY
AS
TEXT
AND
REVEAL
YOUR
SECRETS
BUT
WITH
THE
TAGS
IN
PLACE
ALL
THAT
PERSON
WILL
SEE
IS
A
BLANK
PAGE
THE
FILE
WILL
CORRECTLY
INCLUDE
IN
YOUR
OTHER
PHP
FILES
THE
VARIABLE
WILL
TELL
PHP
WHICH
COMPUTER
TO
USE
WHEN
CONNECTING
TO
A
DATABASE
THIS
IS
REQUIRED
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
ACCESS
MYSQL
DATABASES
ON
ANY
COMPUTER
CONNECTED
TO
YOUR
PHP
INSTALLATION
AND
THAT
POTENTIALLY
INCLUDES
ANY
HOST
ANYWHERE
ON
THE
WEB
HOWEVER
THE
EXAMPLES
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
WILL
BE
WORKING
ON
THE
LOCAL
SERVER
SO
IN
PLACE
OF
SPECIFYING
A
DOMAIN
SUCH
AS
MYSQL
MYSERVER
COM
YOU
CAN
JUST
USE
THE
WORD
LOCALHOST
OR
THE
IP
ADDRESS
THE
DATABASE
WE
LL
BE
USING
IS
THE
ONE
CALLED

WHICH
YOU
PROBABLY
CREATED
IN
CHAPTER
OR
THE
ONE
YOU
WERE
PROVIDED
WITH
BY
YOUR
SERVER
AD
MINISTRATOR
IN
WHICH
CASE
YOU
HAVE
TO
MODIFY

PHP
ACCORDINGLY
THE
VARIABLES
AND
SHOULD
BE
SET
TO
THE
USERNAME
AND
PASSWORD
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
USING
WITH
MYSQL
ANOTHER
BENEFIT
OF
KEEPING
THESE
LOGIN
DETAILS
IN
A
SINGLE
PLACE
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
CHANGE
YOUR
PASSWORD
AS
FREQUENTLY
AS
YOU
LIKE
AND
THERE
WILL
BE
ONLY
ONE

TO

WHEN

AS
IT

YOU

WORRY
YOU

ALREADY
COVERED
MANY
OF
THEM
IN

AND
WHAT
THE
CODE
DOES
IS
ACTUALLY
QUITE
SIMPLE
IT
FIRST
CHECKS
FOR
ANY

THAT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
AND
THEN
EITHER
INSERTS
NEW

REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
THERE
WAS
INPUT
THE

THEN
OUTPUTS
ALL

IN

SO
LET
SEE
HOW
IT
WORKS
THE
FIRST
SECTION
OF
NEW

STARTS
BY
USING
THE
ISSET

TO
CHECK
WHETHER

HAVE
BEEN

UPON
CONFIRMATION
EACH
OF
THE
LINES
WITHIN
THE
IF
STATEMENT
CALLS
THE
FUNCTION
WHICH
APPEARS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE

THIS
FUNCTION
HAS
ONE
SMALL
BUT
CRITICAL
JOB
FETCHING
THE
INPUT
FROM
THE
BROWSER
FIGURE
THE
OUTPUT
FROM
EXAMPLE
SQLTEST
PHP
THE

I
MENTIONED
IN
AN
EARLIER
CHAPTER
THAT
A

SENDS

THROUGH
EITHER
A
GET
REQUEST
OR
A
POST
REQUEST
THE
POST
REQUEST
IS
USUALLY
PREFERRED
AND
WE
USE
IT
HERE
THE
WEB
SERVER
BUNDLES
UP
ALL
OF
THE
USER
INPUT
EVEN
IF
THE
FORM
WAS
FILLED
OUT
WITH
A
HUNDRED

AND
PUTS
IN
INTO
AN

NAMED
IS
AN
ASSOCIATIVE
ARRAY
WHICH
YOU
ENCOUNTERED
IN

DEPENDING
ON
WHETHER
A

HAS
BEEN
SET
TO
USE
THE

THE

EITHER
THE

THE
ASSOCIATIVE

WILL
BE

THEY
CAN
BOTH
BE
READ
IN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
WAY
EACH

HAS
AN

SO
IF

A

THE

CONTAINS
AN

KEYED
BY

ISBN
THE
PHP

CAN
READ
THAT
FIELD
BY
REFERRING
TO
EITHER
ISBN
OR
ISBN
SINGLE
AND
DOUBLE
QUOTES
HAVE
THE
SAME
EFFECT
IN
THIS
CASE
IF
THE
SYNTAX
STILL
SEEMS
COMPLEX
TO
YOU
REST
ASSURED
THAT
YOU
CAN
JUST
USE
THE
CONVENTION
I
VE
SHOWN
IN
EXAMPLE
COPY
THE
USER
INPUT
TO
OTHER

AND
FORGET
ABOUT
AFTER
THAT
THIS
IS
NORMAL
IN
PHP
PROGRAMS
THEY
RETRIEVE
ALL
THE
FIELDS
FROM
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
PROGRAM
AND
THEN
IGNORE
IT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
WRITE
TO
AN
ELEMENT
IN
THE
ARRAY
ITS
ONLY
PURPOSE
IS
TO
COMMUNICATE
INFORMATION
FROM
THE
BROWSER
TO
THE
PRO
GRAM
AND
YOU
RE
BETTER
OFF

TO
YOUR
OWN

YOU

ERYTHING

INSTEAD

THE

COULD
ALSO
DROP

THE
HTML
AND
THEN
REENTER
PHP
PROCESSING
WITH
PHP
WHICHEVER
STYLE
USED
IS
A
MATTER
OF
PROGRAMMER
PREFERENCE
BUT
I
ALWAYS
RECOMMEND
STAYING
WITHIN
PHP
CODE
FOR
THESE
REASONS
IT
MAKES
IT
VERY
CLEAR
WHEN
DEBUGGING
AND
ALSO
FOR
OTHER
USERS
THAT
EVERYTHING
WITHIN
A
PHP
FILE
IS
PHP
CODE
THEREFORE
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
GO
HUNTING
FOR
DROPOUTS
TO
HTML
WHEN
YOU
WISH
TO
INCLUDE
A
PHP
VARIABLE
DIRECTLY
WITHIN
HTML
YOU
CAN
JUST
TYPE
IT

YOU
HAD
DROPPED
BACK

YOU
WOULD
HAVE
HAD

REENTER

NOW
LET
LOOK
AT
HOW
DELETING
A

WORKS
BY

SO
TRY

JUST
THE

AS
WE
LL
BE

LATER
YOU

THAT
YOU

THAT
THERE
IS

PRACTICAL

YOU
ARE
NOW
READY
TO
LOOK
AT
SOME
PRACTICAL
TECHNIQUES
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
IN

TO
ACCESS
THE
MYSQL

INCLUDING
TASKS
SUCH
AS
CREATING
AND
DROPPING
TABLES
INSERTING
UPDATING
AND
DELETING
DATA
AND
PROTECTING
YOUR

FROM
MALICIOUS

YOU

A

ABOUT

THERE
ARE
NINE
FAMILIES
OF

LION
TIGER
JAGUAR
LEOPARD
COUGAR
CHEETAH
LYNX

SO
YOU
LL

THAT
THEN
EACH

HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
A

SO
THAT
ANOTHER

AND
YOU
ALSO
WANT
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
THEIR
AGES
WHICH
IS
ANOTHER

YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
NEED
MORE
COLUMNS
LATER
PERHAPS
TO
HOLD
DIETARY

AND
OTHER

BUT
FOR
NOW
THAT
ENOUGH
TO

A

THE
PROBLEM
THERE
IN
MYSQL
THE
SYMBOL
REPRESENTS
THE
START
OF
A
COM
MENT
THEREFORE
THE
USER
WILL
BE
LOGGED
IN
AS
ADMIN
ASSUMING
THERE
IS
A
USER
ADMIN
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
ENTER
A
PASSWORD
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
THE
PART
OF
THE
QUERY
THAT
WILL
BE
EXECUTED
IS
SHOWN
IN
BOLD
THE
REST
WILL
BE
IGNORED
SELECT
FROM
USERS
WHERE
USER
ADMIN
AND
PASS
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
COUNT
YOURSELF
VERY
LUCKY
IF
THAT
ALL
A
MALICIOUS
USER
DOES
TO
YOU
AT
LEAST
YOU
MIGHT
STILL
BE
ABLE
TO
GO
INTO
YOUR
APPLICATION
AND
UNDO
ANY
CHANGES
THE
USER
MAKES
AS
ADMIN
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
YOUR
APPLICATION
CODE
REMOVES
A
USER
FROM
THE
DATABASE
THE
CODE
MIGHT
LOOK
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
USER
USER
PASS
PASS
QUERY
DELETE
FROM
USERS
WHERE
USER
USER
AND
PASS
PASS
AGAIN
THIS
LOOKS
QUITE
NORMAL
AT
FIRST
GLANCE
BUT
WHAT
IF
SOMEONE
ENTERED
THE
FOLLOWING
FOR
USER
ANYTHING
OR
THIS
WOULD
BE
INTERPRETED
BY
MYSQL
AS
DELETE
FROM
USERS
WHERE
USER
ANYTHING
OR
AND
PASS
OUCH
THAT
SQL
QUERY
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
TRUE
AND
THEREFORE
YOU
VE
LOST
YOUR
WHOLE
USERS
DATABASE
SO
WHAT
CAN
YOU
DO
ABOUT
THIS
KIND
OF
ATTACK
WELL
THE
FIRST
THING
IS
NOT
TO
RELY
ON
PHP
BUILT
IN
MAGIC
QUOTES
WHICH
AUTOMATICALLY
ESCAPE
ANY
CHARACTERS
SUCH
AS
SINGLE
AND
DOUBLE
QUOTES
BY
PREFACING
THEM
WITH
A
BACK
SLASH
WHY
BECAUSE
THIS
FEATURE
CAN
BE
TURNED
OFF
MANY
PROGRAMMERS
DO
SO
IN
ORDER
TO
PUT
THEIR
OWN
SECURITY
CODE
IN
PLACE
SO
THERE
IS
NO
GUARANTEE
THAT
THIS
HASN
T
HAPPENED
ON
THE
SERVER
YOU
ARE
WORKING
ON
IN
FACT
THE
FEATURE
WAS
DEPRECATED
AS
OF
PHP
AND
HAS
BEEN
REMOVED
IN
PHP
INSTEAD
YOU
SHOULD
ALWAYS
USE
THE
FUNCTION
FOR
ALL
CALLS
TO
MYSQL
EXAMPLE
IS
A
FUNCTION
YOU
CAN
USE
THAT
WILL
REMOVE
ANY
MAGIC
QUOTES
ADDED
TO
A
USER
INPUTTED
STRING
AND
THEN
PROPERLY
SANITIZE
IT
FOR
YOU
EXAMPLE
HOW
TO
PROPERLY
SANITIZE
USER
INPUT
FOR
MYSQL
PHP
FUNCTION
STRING
IF
STRING
STRIPSLASHES
STRING
RETURN

THE
FUNCTION
RETURNS
TRUE
IF
MAGIC
QUOTES
ARE
ACTIVE
IN
THAT
CASE
ANY
SLASHES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
ADDED
TO
A
STRING
HAVE
TO
BE
REMOVED
OR
THE
FUNCTION
COULD
END
UP
DOUBLE
ESCAPING
SOME

CREATING
CORRUPTED

REMEMBER
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
ONLY
WHEN
A

OPEN
OTHERWISE
AN
ERROR
WILL
OCCUR
USING
PLACEHOLDERS
ANOTHER
WAY
THIS
ONE
VIRTUALLY
BULLETPROOF
TO
PREVENT
SQL
INJECTIONS
IS
TO
USE
A
FEA
TURE
CALLED
PLACEHOLDERS
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
PREDEFINE
A
QUERY
USING
CHARACTERS
WHERE
THE
DATA
WILL
APPEAR
THEN
INSTEAD
OF
CALLING
A
MYSQL
QUERY
DIRECTLY
YOU
CALL
THE
PREDEFINED
ONE
PASSING
THE
DATA
TO
IT
THIS
HAS
THE
EFFECT
OF
ENSURING
THAT
EVERY
ITEM
OF
DATA
ENTERED
IS
INSERTED
DIRECTLY
INTO
THE
DATABASE
AND
CANNOT
BE
INTERPRETED
AS
SQL
QUERIES
IN
OTHER

BECOME
IMPOSSIBLE

THE

ASSIGN

THE

THESE

FI
NALLY
THE

IS
REMOVED
IN

TO
RETURN
THE

IT
WAS
USING

THE

LOOKS

THAT
YOU
HAVE
CREATED

IT
YOU
CAN
USE
IT
AS
OFTEN
AS
YOU
WISH
SUCH
STATEMENTS
ARE
COMMONLY
USED
WITHIN
A
LOOP
TO
QUICKLY
INSERT
DATA
INTO
A
DATABASE
BY
ASSIGNING
VALUES
TO
THE
MYSQL
VARIABLES
AND
THEN
EXECUTING
THE

THIS
APPROACH
IS
MORE
EFFICIENT
THAN
CREATING
THE
ENTIRE

FROM
SCRATCH
ON
EACH
PASS
THROUGH
THE

PREVENTING
HTML
INJECTION
THERE
ANOTHER
TYPE
OF
INJECTION
YOU
NEED
TO
CONCERN
YOURSELF
ABOUT
NOT
FOR
THE
SAFETY
OF
YOUR
OWN
WEBSITES
BUT
FOR
YOUR
USERS
PRIVACY
AND
PROTECTION
THAT
CROSS
SITE
SCRIPT
ING
ALSO
REFERRED
TO
AS

THIS
OCCURS
WHEN
YOU
ALLOW
HTML
OR
MORE
OFTEN
JAVASCRIPT
CODE
TO
BE
INPUT
BY
A
USER
AND
THEN
DISPLAYED
BACK
BY
YOUR
WEBSITE
ONE
PLACE
THIS
IS
COMMON
IS
IN
A
COMMENT
FORM
WHAT
HAPPENS
MOST
OFTEN
IS
THAT
A
MALICIOUS
USER
WILL
TRY
TO
WRITE

THAT
STEALS
COOKIES
FROM
YOUR

USERS
ALLOWING
HIM
OR
HER
TO
DISCOVER
USERNAME
AND

PAIRS
OR
OTHER
INFORMATION
EVEN
WORSE
THE
MALICIOUS
USER
MIGHT
LAUNCH
AN
ATTACK
TO
DOWNLOAD
A
TROJAN
ONTO
A
USER
COMPUTER
BUT
PREVENTING
THIS
IS
AS
SIMPLE
AS
CALLING
THE
HTMLENTITIES
FUNCTION
WHICH
STRIPS
OUT
ALL
HTML
MARKUP
CODES
AND
REPLACES
THEM
WITH
A
FORM
THAT
DISPLAYS
THE
CHARACTERS
BUT
DOES
NOT
ALLOW
A

ON

THIS
I
RECOMMEND
THAT

CREATE

WERE

SOME

WE
RE

THAT
THOSE
WHO

NOT

THE
RELATIVE
INEFFICACY

MAY
BE
A

IN

BECAUSE
THE

ARE
HARD

SLOW

WHAT

YOU
CUT

THE

OF

PROPOSE
MEASURES
THAT
YOU
CAN

TO

A
HEALTHY

ENVIRONMENT
CHAPTER
THE

POLICE
SUPPOSE
THAT
IN
ADDITION
TO
YOUR
PRESENT
DUTIES
YOU
WERE
MADE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
SPACE
AND
SERVICES
FOR
YOUR
PEOPLE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
KIND
OF

FOR
EACH
PERSON
AND
THE
AMOUNT
OF
SPACE
AND
EXPENSE
TO
BE
ALLOCATED
HOW
WOULD
YOU
GO
ABOUT
IT
YOU
D
PROBABLY
WANT
TO
STUDY
THE
WAYS
IN
WHICH
PEOPLE
USE
THEIR
SPACE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TABLE
SPACE
REQUIRED
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
HOURS
IN
A
DAY
SPENT
WORKING
ALONE
WORKING
WITH
ONE
OTHER
PERSON
AND
SO
FORTH
YOU
D
ALSO
INVESTIGATE
THE
IMPACT
OF
NOISE
ON
PEOPLE
EFFECTIVENESS
AFTER
ALL
YOUR
FOLKS
ARE
INTEL
LECT
WORKERS
THEY
NEED
TO
HAVE
THEIR
BRAINS
IN
GEAR
TO
DO
THEIR
WORK
AND
NOISE
DOES
AFFECT
THEIR
ABILITY
TO
CONCENTRATE
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
OBSERVED
KINDS
OF
DISTURBANCE
YOU
D
LOOK
FOR
ANY
EASY
MECHANICAL
WAY
TO
PROTECT
YOUR
WORKERS
GIVEN
A
REASONABLY
FREE
HAND
YOU
WOULD
INVESTIGATE
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
CLOSED
SPACE
ONE
AND
TWO
AND
THREE
PERSON
OFFICES
VERSUS
OPEN
SPACE
THIS
WOULD
ALLOW
YOU
TO
MAKE
A
SENSIBLE
TRADE
OFF
OF
COST
AGAINST
PRIVACY
AND
QUIET
FINALLY
YOU
WOULD
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
PEOPLE
SOCIAL
NEEDS
AND
PROVIDE
SOME
AREAS
WHERE
A
CONVERSA
TION
COULD
TAKE
PLACE
WITHOUT
DISTURBING
OTHERS
IT
SHOULD
COME
AS
NO
SURPRISE
TO
YOU
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
CONTROL
SPACE
AND
SERVICES
FOR
YOUR
COMPANY
PARTICULARLY
IF
IT
A
LARGE
COMPANY
DON
T
SPEND
MUCH
TIME
THINKING
ABOUT
ANY
OF
THE
CONCERNS
LISTED

THEY
DON
T
COLLECT
ANY
RAW
DATA
THEY
DON
T
STRIVE
TO

PART
PEOPLEWARE
OF
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT

DOING
THE
KIND
OF

LIKELY
TO
SUFFER
FROM
A
POOR

THEY
OFTEN
CONSTITUTE

WHOSE
APPROACH
TO

IS
NEARLY
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
WHAT
YOUR

WOULD
BE
THE

THE

IS
THAT

THE

THROUGH

YOU
HAVE
NO

WHETHER
YOU

THOSE

THEY

THEY

FROM
THE

THAT

A

TAINLY
A

BUILT
ON

WEREN
T
WORTH

HOW
TO
EXPLAIN
THEN
THE
FACT
THAT

PEOPLE
AS

AS

IN
OTHER

INTENSIVE

ARE
PUTTING
IN
SO
MANY

YOU

A

INDICTMENT
OF

THE
AMAZING

IS
NOT
THAT
IT
SO
OFTEN
IMPOSSIBLE
TO

IN

THE
AMAZING

IS
THAT
EVERYONE
KNOWS
IT
AND
NOBODY
EVER
DOES

ABOUT

A

A

THE

ASPECTS
OF
THEIR

THE

WHO
RAN

WAS
VERY
EXCI
TED
ABOUT
THE

THE

HAD
UNDERTAKEN
HE
TOLD

THAT
THE

TWO
PROBLEM
WAS
POOR
COM
MUNICATION
WITH

LEARNED
THAT
FROM
THE

THE

SET

CLES

AND
OTHER
COMMUNICATION
PRO
GRAMS
I
LISTENED
POLITELY
AS
HE
DESCRIBED
THEM
IN

WHEN
HE
WAS
DONE
I
ASKED
WHAT
THE
NUMBER
ONE
PROBLEM
WAS
THE
ENVIRONMENT
HE
REPLIED
PEOPLE
WERE
UPSET
ABOUT
THE
NOISE
I
ASKED
WHAT
STEPS
THE

HAD
TAKEN
TO
REMEDY
THAT
PROBLEM
OH
WE
COULDN
T
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THAT
HE
SAID
THAT
OUTSIDE
OUR
CONTROL
JDM
ALL
THE
MORE
DISCOURAGING
IS
THAT
THE
MANAGER
WASN
T
EVEN
PARTICULARLY
EMBARRASSED
ABOUT
FAILING
TO
TAKE
STEPS
TO
IMPROVE
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
THE
PROGRAMMERS
HAD
COMPLAINED
THAT
THERE
WAS
TOO
MUCH
GRAVITY
AND

HAD
DECIDED
AFTER
DUE
REFLECTION
THAT
THEY
COULDN
T
REALLY
DO
MUCH
ABOUT
IT
IT
WAS
A

WHOSE
SOLUTION
WAS
BEYOND

CAPACITY
THIS
IS
A

OF
TOTAL

CHANGING
THE

IS
NOT
BEYOND

THERE
IS

IN

EVERY

A

THAT
HAS
DOMAIN
OVER

IT
NOT

TO
MAKE

OR
TO
WREST

AWAY
FROM

THE

OF

THERE
IS

WE

THE

DOES
NOT

PROVE
THAT
A

IT
MAY

INDICATE
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO

TEND

TOWARD

THAT

DOES
THAT
REALLY
MATTER
TO
YOU
IN
THE
LONG

WHAT

DOES
IT
MAKE
WHETHER
QUIET
SPACE
AND

HELP
YOUR
CURRENT
PEOPLE
TO
DO
BETTER
WORK
OR
HELP
YOU
TO
ATTRACT
AND
KEEP
BETTER
PEOPLE
IF
WE
PROVED
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
IT
THAT
A
POLICY
OF
DEFAULT
ON

CHARACTERISTICS
IS
A
MISTAKE
IF
YOU
PARTICIPATE
IN
OR
MAN
AGE
A

OF

WHO
NEED
TO
USE
THEIR

DURING
THE

THEN
THE

IS
YOUR

IT
ISN
T
ENOUGH
TO
OBSERVE
YOU
NEVER
GET

DONE
AROUND
HERE
BETWEEN

THEN
TURN
YOUR
ATTENTION
TO
SOMETHING

IT

THAT

CHAPTER
SAVING
MONEY
ON
SPACE
IF
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
IS
ANYTHING
LIKE
THOSE
STUDIED
IN
OUR
LAST
THREE
ANNUAL
SURVEYS
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
TREND
IS
TOWARD
LESS
PRIVACY
LESS
DEDICATED
SPACE
AND
MORE
NOISE
OF
COURSE
THE
OBVIOUS
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
COST
A
PENNY
SAVED
ON
THE
WORKSPACE
IS
A
PENNY
EARNED
ON
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
OR
SO
THE
LOGIC
GOES
THOSE
WHO
MAKE
SUCH
A
JUDGMENT
ARE
GUILTY
OF
PERFORMING
A
COST
BENEFIT
STUDY
WITHOUT
BENEFIT
OF
STUDYING
THE
BENEFIT
THEY
KNOW
THE
COST
BUT
HAVEN
T
ANY
IDEA
WHAT
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
EQUATION
MAY
BE
SURE
THE
SAVINGS
OF
A
COST
REDUCED
WORKPLACE
ARE
ATTRACTIVE
BUT
COMPARED
TO
WHAT
THE
OBVIOUS
ANSWER
IS
THAT
THE
SAVINGS
HAVE
TO
BE
COMPARED
TO
THE
RISK
OF
LOST
EFFECTIVENESS
GIVEN
THE
CURRENT
ASSAULT
ON
WORKPLACE
COSTS
IT
SURPRISING
HOW
LITTLE
THE
POTENTIAL
SAVINGS
ARE
COMPARED
TO
THE
POTENTIAL
RISK
THE
ENTIRE
COST
OF

FOR
ONE
DEVELOPER
IS
A
SMALL
PERCENT
AGE
OF
THE
SALARY
PAID
TO
THE
DEVELOPER
HOW
SMALL
DEPENDS
ON
SUCH
FACTORS
AS
REAL

VALUES
SALARY

AND

VERSUS

IN
GENERAL
IT
VARIES
IN
THE
RANGE
FROM
TO
PERCENT
FOR
A
PROGRAMMER
ANALYST
WORKING
IN
COMPANY
OWNED
SPACE
YOU
SHOULD
EXPECT
TO
PAY
DIRECTLY
TO
THE

FOR
EVERY
DOLLAR
YOU
SPEND
ON

AND

IF
YOU
ADD
THE

FOR

THE

COULD
EASILY
BE

THE

OF

THE
RATIO
IMPLIES
THAT

COST
REDUCTION
IS
RISKY
ATTEMPTS
TO
SAVE
A
SMALL
PORTION
OF
THE
ONE

MAY
CAUSE
YOU
TO
SACRIFICE
A
LARGE
PORTION
OF

THE

COULD

NOT

INTO
CHEAPER
NOISIER
AND
MORE
CROWD
ED

WITHOUT
FIRST
ASSESSING
WHETHER

EFFECTIVENESS
WOULD
BE
IMPAIRED
SO
YOU
MIGHT
EXPECT
THAT
THE
PLANNERS
WHO
HAVE
UNDERTAKEN
A
DECADE
LONG
PROGRAM
TO
CHANGE
OUR
OFFICE
SPACE
INTO
THE

MUST
FIRST
HAVE

SOME
VERY
CAREFUL

SO
WOULD

AN

FOR

A

THE

WE
GOT

CARRELS
WHERE
NO

IT
WAS

IT

AS
MY

IT
WAS

TRL
IF
YOU

YOU
MAY
FIND
THREE

IF
YOU

SOME

AND
FINALLY
NAIL
DOWN
THE

THAT

BUT

THAT
GILB
LAW
TWO
YEARS
AGO
AT
A
CONFERENCE
IN
LONDON
I
SPENT
AN
AFTERNOON
WITH
TOM
GILB
THE
AUTHOR
OF

METRICS
AND
DOZENS
OF
PUBLISHED
PAPERS
ON
MEASURE
MENT
OF
THE

PROCESS
I
FOUND
THAT
AN
EASY
WAY
TO
GET
HIM
HEATED
UP
WAS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
SOMETHING
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
IS
UNMEASURABLE
THE
MAN
WAS
OFFENDED
BY
THE
VERY
IDEA
HE
FAVORED
ME
THAT
DAY
WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
WHAT
HE
CONSIDERED
A
FUNDAMENTAL
TRUTH
ABOUT
MEASURABILITY
THE
IDEA
SEEMED
AT
ONCE
SO
WISE
AND
SO
ENCOURAGING
THAT
I
COPIED
IT
VERBATIM
INTO
MY
JOURNAL
UNDER
THE
HEADING
OF
GILB
LAW
ANYTHING
YOU
NEED
TO
QUANTIFY
CAN
BE
MEASURED
IN
SOME
WAY
THAT
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
NOT
MEASURING
IT
AT
ALL
GILB
LAW
DOESN
T
PROMISE
YOU
THAT
MEASUREMENT
WILL
BE
FREE
OR
EVEN
CHEAP
AND
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
PERFECT
JUST
BETTER
THAN
NOTHING
TDM
OF
COURSE
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
MEASURE
PRODUCTIVITY
IF
YOU
CON
VOKE
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
DOING
THE
SAME
OR
SIMILAR
WORK
AND
GIVE
THEM
A
DAY
TO
WORK
OUT
A
SENSIBLE
SELF
MEASUREMENT
SCHEME
THEY
WILL
COME
UP
WITH
SOMETHING
THAT
CONFIRMS
GILB
LAW
THE
NUM
BERS
THEY
THEN
GENERATE
WILL
GIVE
THEM
SOME
WAY
TO
TUNE
THEIR
OWN
PERFORMANCE
AND
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
QUALITY
CIRCLES
OR
SOME
OTHER
PEER
REVIEW
MECHANISM
A
WAY
TO
LEARN
FROM

OTHER

THE

SUSPECTED
THEY

OOOPS

HAVE
JUST
COME
BACK
TO
TELL

THAT
THEY

THE

FIVE

NOW
YOUR

IT

THIS

IF

THAT

THE

INTERRUPT
CONSCIOUSNESS

SECOND
IT
CREATES
A
RECORD
OF
HOW

TIME
IS
APPLIED
TO

IF
A

TO

THREE
THOUSAND

TO

THEN
YOU

REASON
TO

YOU
RE
TWO
THIRDS

WHEN

BEEN

THE
E
FACTOR
IF

THE

THAT

TO

THE
POSSIBILITY
OF

THE

IT

EVERYONE

LABS
WE
WORKED
IN
TWO

THEY
WERE

AND
THE

COULD
BE

I
SHARED
MY

WITH
WENDL
THOMIS
WHO
WENT
ON

A

AS
AN

IN

WAS

THE

OUR

WENDLL
WHAT
ARE
YOU
DOING
WENDL
SAID
I
M
THINKING
AND
THE

SAID
CAN

YOU
DO
THAT
AT

TDM
THE

BETWEEN
THAT

AND
A

MODERN

PLAN
IS
THAT
IN
THOSE

ONE
AT

HAD
THE
OPTION
OF

ON
THE

IN

OF
THE

WE
ENCOUNTER
TODAY
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
NOISE
AND
INTERRUPTION
TO

ANY

VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
MORE
IS
THE
SHAME
YOUR

PEOPLE
BRING
THEIR

WITH

EVERY

THEY
COULD
PUT
THEM
TO

FOR
YOU
AT
NO

IF
ONLY
THERE
WERE
A
SMALL
MEASURE
OF
PEACE
AND
QUIET
IN

CHAPTER
THE

WHEN

ABOUT
THE

YOUR

IS
AUTOMATICALLY

ON
ONE
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
CAUSES
OF

THE
INCOMING

CALL
IT
NOTHING
TO
FIELD
FIFTEEN
CALLS
IN
A
DAY
IT
MAY
BE
NOTHING
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ASSO
CIATED
REIMMERSION
TIME
IT
CAN
USE
UP
MOST
OF
THAT
DAY
WHEN
THE

IS
OVER
AND
YOU
RE
WONDERING
WHERE
THE

WENT
YOU
CAN
SELDOM
EVEN
REMEMBER
WHO
CALLED
YOU
OR
WHY
EVEN
IF
SOME
OF
THE
CALLS
WERE
IMPORTANT
THEY
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
WORTH
INTERRUPTING
YOUR
FLOW
BUT
WHO
GOT
THE
NERVES
TO
WAIT
OUT
A
RINGING
PHONE
THE
VERY
THOUGHT
OF
IT
MAKES
YOU
TENSE
BETWEEN
THE

VISIT
TO
AN

NOW
JUST
RELAX
AND
IMAGINE
A

IN

YOU

AN

THE

THIS
IS
THE

THE

UNWRAPS
A
LARGE
BLACK

WITH
A
CRANK
ON
THE

AND
AN
ENORMOUS

ATTACHED
TO
THE

THIS
IS
THE
FUTURE
WE
RE
GOING
TO
PUT
ONE
OF
THESE
ON
EVERY
DESK
IN

HOMES
TOO
IT
WILL
GET
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
PEOPLE
CAN
HARDLY
IMAGINE
A
WORLD
WITHOUT
THEM
AS
HE
WARMS
UP
TO
HIS
SUBJECT
HE
BEGINS
GESTICULATING
ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AND
HOPPING
AROUND
THE
ROOM
TO
MAKE
HIS
POINTS
BELLOPHONES
EVERYWHERE
YOU
LOOK
ALL
OF
THEM
HOOKED
UP
TOGETHER
WITH
WIRES
UNDER
THE
STREET
OR
OVERHEAD
AND
NOW
THIS
IS
THE
REALLY
EXCITING
PART
YOU
CAN
GET
YOUR
BELLOPHONE
SPECIFICALLY
CONNECTED
TO
SOMEBODY
ELSE
BELLOPHONE
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
ALL
THE
WAY
ACROSS
THE
CITY
OR
MAYBE
IN
SOME
OTHER
CITY
AND
WHEN
YOU
VE
CONNECTED
IT
JUST
BY
ENTERING
THE
CODE
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
BELL
RING
ON
THE
OTHER
FELLOW
MACHINE
NOT
JUST
SOME
RINKY
DINK
BELL
EITHER
BUT
A
REAL
HEART
STOPPER
HE
SETS
UP
A
SECOND
DEVICE
AND
CONNECTS
IT
TO
THE
FIRST
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ROOM
BY
MANIPULATING
A
DIAL
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
FIRST
HE
CAUSES
THE
OTHER
MACHINE
TO
COME
ALIVE
IT
GIVES
OFF
A
LOUD
BRRRRINNNNNNNGGGGGGG
AFTER
HALF
A
SECOND
IT
RINGS
AGAIN
AND
THEN
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
DEAFENINGLY
NOW
WHAT
A
FELLOW
GOT
TO
DO
TO
STOP
THIS
RINGING
HE
GOT
TO
RACE
OVER
TO
HIS
BELLOPHONE
AND
PICK
UP
THE
RECEIVER
HE
PICKS
UP
THE
RECEIVER
ON
THE
RINGING
DEVICE
AND
HANDS
IT
TO
ONE
OF
THE
COMMITTEE
MEMBERS
THEN
HE
BOUNDS
BACK
TO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ROOM
AND
STARTS
SHOUTING
INTO
THE
MOUTHPIECE
OF
THE
ORIGINATING
DEVICE
HELLO
HELLO
CAN
YOU
HEAR
ME
SEE
THAT
I
VE
GOT
HIS
COMPLETE
ATTENTION
NOW
I
CAN
SELL
HIM
SOMETHING
OR
GET
HIM
TO
LEND
ME
MONEY
OR
TRY
TO
CHANGE
HIS
RELIGION
OR
WHATEVER
I
WANT
THE
COMMITTEE
IS
STUNNED
YOU
RAISE
YOUR
HAND
AND
VENTURE
A
QUESTION
SINCE
NOBODY
COULD
POSSIBLY
HAVE
MISSED
THE
FIRST
RING
WHY
BOTHER
TO
REPEAT
IT
AH
THAT
THE
BEAUTY
OF
THE
BELLOPHONE
SAYS
A
G
IT
NEVER
GIVES
YOU
THE
CHANCE
TO
WONDER
WHETHER
YOU
WANT
TO
ANSWER
IT
OR
NOT
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
RE
INVOLVED
IN
AT
THE
TIME
IT
RINGS
NO
MATTER
HOW
ENGROSSED
YOU
ARE
YOU
DROP
EVERYTHING
TO
ANSWER
IT
OTHERWISE
YOU
KNOW
IT
WILL
JUST
KEEP
ON
RINGING
WE
RE
GOING
TO
SELL
BILLIONS
OF
THESE
THINGS
AND
NEVER
EVER
ALLOW
ANY
TO
BE
SOLD
THAT
RING
ONLY
ONCE
THE
COMMITTEE
GOES
INTO
A
HUDDLE
BUT
IT
DOESN
T
TAKE
VERY
LONG
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
JUDGMENT
YOU
ALL
DECIDE
WITHOUT
A
DISSENT
ING
VOICE
TO
THROW
THIS
TURKEY
OUT
THE
DOOR
THE
DEVICE
IS
SO
DISRUPTIVE
THAT
IF
YOU
WERE
EVER
DUMB
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
IT
TO
BE
THE
TELEPHONE
INSTALLED
NOBODY
WOULD
EVER
GET
ANY
WORK
DONE
AROUND
THE
OFFICE
A
FEW
YEARS
EFFECT
OF
THE
BELLOPHONE
AND
WE
D
ALL
BE
REDUCED
TO
BUYING
GOODS
FROM
TAIWAN
AND
KOREA
AND
OUR
COUNTRY
MIGHT
EVEN
HAVE
A
NEGATIVE
BALANCE
OF
TRADE
TALES
FROM
THE
CRYPT
OF
COURSE
THERE
NO
TURNING
THE
CALENDAR
BACK
THE
TELEPHONE
IS
HERE
TO
STAY
YOU
CAN
T
GET
RID
OF
IT
NOR
WOULD
YOU
PROBABLY
WANT
TO
YOU
CERTAINLY
CAN
T
REMOVE
PHONES
FROM
PEOPLE
DESKS
WITHOUT
CAUSING
THEM
TO
REVOLT
BUT
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
STEPS
THAT
CAN
BE
TAKEN
TO
MINIMIZE
THE
NEGATIVE
IMPACT
OF
INTERRUPTIVE
CALLS
THE
MOST
IM
PORTANT
OF
THESE
IS
TO
REALIZE
HOW
MUCH
WE
HAVE
ALLOWED
THE
TELE
PHONE
TO
DOMINATE
OUR
TIME
ALLOCATION
DO
YOU
OFTEN
INTERRUPT
A
DISCUSSION
WITH
CO
WORKERS
OR
FRIENDS
TO
ANSWER
A
PHONE
OF
COURSE
YOU
DO
YOU
DON
T
EVEN
CONSIDER
NOT
ANSWERING
THE
PHONE
YET
WHAT
YOU
RE
DOING
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THE
COMMON
RULES
OF
FAIRNESS
TAKING
PEOPLE
OUT
OF

JUST
BECAUSE
THEYINSISTLOUDLY
BBBRRRRHINNNNGGGGG
ONYOURATTENTION
NOT
ONLY
DO
YOU
DO
THIS
TO
OTHERS
YOU
LET
THEM
DO
IT
TO
YOU
AND
YOU
RE
SO
INURED
TO
THIS
ABUSE
THAT
YOU
HARDLY
TAKE
NOTE
OF
IT
ONLY
IN
THE
MOST
OUTRAGEOUS
CASES
IS
IT
CLEAR
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
DEFINITELY
WRONG
WITH
SUCH
BEHAVIOR
NEARLY
TWENTY
YEARS
AGO
I
WAS
STANDING
IN
LINE
AT
THE
PARTS
DEPARTMENT
OF
THE
NEW
YORK
DEALER
FOR
MORGAN
MOTORCARS
LIMITED
I
HAD
A
NON
FUNCTIONING
MORGAN
THE
ONLY
KIND
AND
WAS
HOPING
TO
GET
SOME
NEW
CARBURETOR
NEEDLES
PEOPLE
WHO
DRIVE
BRITISH
SPORTS
CARS
ARE
UNDOUBTEDLY
MASOCHISTS
BUT
THE
TREATMENT
IN
THAT
PARTS
LINE
WAS
JUST
TOO
MUCH
THE
CLERK
TOOK
ONE
PHONE
CALL
AFTER
ANOTHER
WHILE
EVERYONE
IN
LINE
WAITED
WHEN
I
GOT
TO
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
LINE
HE
TOOK
FOUR
CALLS
IN
QUICK
SUCCESSION
BEFORE
I
COULD
GET
IN
A
SINGLE
WORD
I
BEGAN
THINKING
WHY
SHOULD
PEOPLE
CALLING
FROM
THE
COMFORT
OF
THEIR
HOMES
GET
PRIORITY
OVER
THOSE
OF
US
STANDING
HERE
IN
THIS
STUPID
LINE
WHY
SHOULD
THOSE
MERE
WINDOW
SHOPPERS
BE
TAKEN
AHEAD
OF
CUSTOMERS
WITH
MONEY
IN
THEIR
HANDS
READY
TO
BUY
IN
A
STATE
OF
PURE
RED
RAGE
I
SUGGESTED
THAT
HE
LET
THE
PHONE
RING
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
TAKE
PEOPLE
AHEAD
OF
BELLS
TO
MY
PEOPLEWARE
SURPRISE
HE
WAS
MORE
ANNOYED
BY
MY
BEHAVIOR
THAN
I
WAS
BY
HIS
HE
INFORMED
ME
VERY
HUFFILY
THAT
PHONES
GET
PRIORITY
OVER
PEOPLE
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL
THERE
WAS
TO
IT
MY
NOT
LIKING
IT
WAS
AS
POINTLESS
AS
NOT
LIKING
THE
ATLANTIC
OCEAN
THE
FACTS
OF
LIFE
WEREN
T
GOING
TO
CHANGE
JUST
TO
SUIT
ME
TDM
IT
IS
NATURAL
THAT
THE
TELEPHONE
SHOULD
HAVE
RESHAPED
SOMEWHAT
THE
WAY
WE
DO
BUSINESS
BUT
IT
OUGHT
NOT
TO
HAVE
BLINDED
US
TO
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
INTERRUPTIONS
AT
THE
LEAST
MANAGERS
OUGHT
TO
BE
ALERT
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
INTERRUPTION
CAN
HAVE
ON
THEIR
OWN
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
GET
SOMETHING
DONE
BUT
OFTEN
IT
THE
MANAGER
WHO
IS
THE
WORST
OFFENDER
ONE
OF
THE
PROGRAMMERS
IN
THE
CODING
WAR
GAMES
WROTE
ON
HIS
ENVIRONMENTAL
SURVEY
WHEN
MY
BOSS
IS
OUT
HE
HAS
HIS
CALLS
SWITCHED
TO
ME
WHAT
COULD
THAT
MANAGER
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
IN
THE
MIND
OF
THE
SYSTEMS
DEPARTMENT
HEAD
WHO
WROTE
MIS
IN
A
MEMO
IT
HAS
COME
TO
MY
ATTENTION
THAT
MANY
OF
YOU
WHEN
YOU
ARE
BUSY
ARE
LETTING
YOUR
PHONES
RING
FOR
THREE
RINGS
AND
THUS
GET
SWITCHED
OVER
TO
ONE
OF
THE
SECRETARIES
WITH
ALL
THESE
INTERRUPTIONS
THE
SECRETARIES
CAN
NEVER
GET
ANY
PRODUCTIVE
WORK
DONE
THE
OFFICIAL
POLICY
HERE
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
RE
AT
YOUR
DESK
YOU
WILL
ANSWER
YOUR
PHONE
BEFORE
THE
THIRD
RING
A
MODIFIED
TELEPHONE
ETHIC
ENOUGH
IS
ENOUGH
THE
PATH
TOWARD
SANITY
IN
WORKING
CONDITIONS
IS
A
NEW
ATTITUDE
TOWARD
INTERRUPTIONS
AND
TOWARD
THE
TELEPHONE
PEO
PLE
WHO
ARE
CHARGED
WITH
GETTING
WORK
DONE
MUST
HAVE
SOME
PEACE
AND
QUIET
TO
DO
IT
IN
THAT
MEANS
PERIODS
OF
TOTAL
FREEDOM
FROM
INTERRUPTIONS
WHEN
THEY
WANT
TO
WORK
IN
FLOW
THEY
HAVE
TO
HAVE
SOME
EFFICIENT
ACCEPTABLE
WAY
OF
IGNORING
INCOMING
CALLS
ACCEPTABLE
MEANS
THE
CORPORATE
CULTURE
REALIZES
THAT
PEOPLE
MAY
SOMETIMES
CHOOSE
TO
BE
UNAVAILABLE
FOR
INTERRUPTION
BY
PHONE
EFFICIENT
MEANS
THAT
THEY
DON
T
HAVE
TO
WAIT
OUT
THE
BELL
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
BACK
TO
WORK
THERE
ARE
WORKABLE
SCHEMES
TO
HELP
PEOPLE
FREE
THEMSELVES
FROM
PHONES
AND
OTHER
INTERRUPTIONS
WHEN
THEY
FIND
IT
NECESSARY
THE

SOME
OF
THESE
COST
MONEY
AND
THUS
WILL
BE
POSSIBLE
ONLY
IN
ORGANIZATIONS
WHOSE
LONG

VIEW
EXTENDS
BEYOND
NEXT
TUESDAY
WHEN
ELECTRONIC

WAS
FIRST
PROPOSED
MOST
OF
US
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
GREAT
VALUE
OF
IT
WOULD
BE
THE
SAVING
IN
PAPER
THAT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
TRIVIAL
HOWEVER
COMPARED
TO
THE
SAVING
IN
REIMMERSION
TIME
THE
BIG
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
PHONE
CALL
AND
AN
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
THE
PHONE
CALL
INTERRUPTS
AND
THE
E
MAIL
DOES
NOT
THE
RECEIVER
DEALS
WITH
IT
AT
HIS
OR
HER
OWN
CONVENIENCE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TRAFFIC
GOING
THROUGH
THESE
SYSTEMS
PROVES
THAT
PRIORITY
AT
THE
RECEIVER
CONVENIENCE
IS
ACCEPTABLE
FOR
THE
GREAT
MAJORI
TY
OF
BUSINESS
COMMUNICATIONS
AFTER
A
PERIOD
OF
ACCLIMATIZATION
WORKERS
BEGIN
TO
USE
ELECTRONIC

IN
PREFERENCE
TO

COMPANY

IT
DOESN
T
MAKE
ALL
THE
CALLS
GO
AWAY
ONLY
MOST
YOU
PROBABLY
HAVE
THE

ALREADY
MOST
OF
US
NOW
HAVE
PERFECTLY

THE

IT
IS
IN
THE

GENTLE

NOTE
THIS

WE

DESERVE
AN

CAN
I
CONTINUE
TO

DONE
WHILE
I

FOR
AN

DOES
THIS

NEED

RECOGNITION
IF
NOT
HOW
LONG
CAN
IT

WITHOUT

A

ONCE
YOU
ASK
THESE

YOUR

OF

IS
USUALLY
PRETTY

FOR

HOW
RELIABLE
IS
THE
MODE
FOR

HOW
LONG
WILL
YOUR

SIT
THERE
WILL
IT
ACTUALLY
GET

WILL
IT
GO
DIRECTLY
TO
THE

FOR

PEOPLE
HAVE
TO

PIECES
WHEN
HE
GETS
TO
THE
OFFICE
HE
DOCKS
HIS
LAPTOP
AND
SENDS
HIS
RESPONSES
THE
TRICK
IS
HE
DRIVES
IN
BY
HIMSELF
EVERY
MORNING
TRL
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
ANY
GIMMICK
YOU
INTRODUCE
IS
A
CHANGE
IN
ATTITUDE
PEOPLE
MUST
LEARN
THAT
IT
OKAY
SOMETIMES
NOT
TO
ANSWER
THEIR
PHONES
AND
THEY
MUST
LEARN
THAT
THEIR
TIME
NOT
JUST
THE
QUANTITY
BUT
ITS
QUALITY
IS
IMPORTANT
CHAPTER
BRING
BACK
THE
DOOR
THERE
ARE
SOME
PREVALENT
SYMBOLS
OF
SUCCESS
AND
FAILURE
IN
CREATING
A
SENSIBLE
WORKPLACE
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
SYMBOL
OF
SUCCESS
IS
THE
DOOR
WHEN
THERE
ARE
SUFFICIENT
DOORS
WORKERS
CAN
CONTROL
NOISE
AND
MTERRUPTABILITY
TO
SUIT
THEIR
CHANGING
NEEDS
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
SYMBOL
OF
FAILURE
IS
THE
PAGING
SYSTEM
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
REGULARLY
INTERRUPT
EVERYONE
TO
LOCATE
ONE
PERSON
ARE
SHOWING
THEM
SELVES
TO
BE
TOTALLY
INSENSITIVE
TO
THE
IMPERATIVES
OF
A
WORK
CON
DUCIVE
ENVIRONMENT
MANIPULATE
THESE
SYMBOLS
AND
YOU
NOT
ONLY
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
YOUR
CONCERN
FOR
A
WORKABLE
ENVIRONMENT
YOU
ALSO
REAP
THE
IMME
DIATE
ASSOCIATED
ADVANTAGE
PEOPLE
CAN
GET
ON
WITH
THE
WORK
BUT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
TALL
ORDER
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
PAGING
SYSTEM
AND
BRING
BACK
THE
DOOR
IS
IT
BEYOND
OUR
CAPACITY
TO
EFFECT
THESE
CHANGES
THE
SHOW
ISN
T
OVER
TILL
THE
FAT
LADY
SINGS
THE
DEGRADATION
OF
WORKING
CONDITIONS
THAT
HAS
AFFECTED
MOST
OF
US
OVER
THE
PAST
TEN
YEARS
HAS
DEPENDED
ON
THE
CONSENT
OF
THE
VICTIM
THAT
DOESN
T
MEAN
THAT
ONE
SUCH
VICTIM
COULD
HAVE
HALTED
THE
TREND
BY
SAYING
NO
I
WON
T
WORK
IN
NOISY
CRAMPED
EXPOSED
SPACE
BUT
IT
DOES
MEAN
THAT
WE
AS
A
GROUP
HAVEN
T
HOLLERED
LOUD
ENOUGH
AND
OFTEN
ENOUGH
ABOUT
THE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
SIDE
EFFECTS
OF
SAVING
MONEY
ON
SPACE
WHILE
MOST
OF
US
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
TREND
TOWARD
NOISIER
TIGHTER
SPACE
WAS
HURTING
PRODUCTIVITY
WE
KEPT
SILENT
BECAUSE
WE
LACKED
PEOPLEWARE
THE
DEFINITIVE
STATISTICAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
PROVED
OUR
CASE
THE
FURNITURE
POLICE
OF
COURSE
DIDN
T
PROVIDE
ANY
PROOF
AT
ALL
TO
SUPPORT
THEIR
CONTENTION
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
JUST
AS
PRODUCTIVE
WORKING
CHEEK
BY
JOWL
AS
THEY
HAD
BEEN
IN
A
MORE
SENSIBLE
ENVIRONMENT
THEY
JUST
ASSERTED
THAT
IT
WAS
TRUE
WE
NEED
TO
LEARN
FROM
THEM
LEARN
TO
FIGHT
FIRE
WITH
FIRE
SO
THE
FIRST
STEP
TOWARD
A
SANE
ENVIRONMENT
IS
A
PROGRAM
OF
REPEATED
ASSERTION
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IS
WORKING
AGAINST
YOU
YOU
VE
GOT
TO
START
SAYING
SO
YOU
LL
NEED
TO
CREATE
A
FORUM
FOR
OTHER
PEOPLE
TO
CHIME
IN
TOO
PERHAPS
WITH
A
SURVEY
OF
PEOPLE
ASSESSMENT
OF
THEIR
WORKING
CONDITIONS
IN
ONE
SUCH
SURVEY
AT
A
CLIENT
COMPANY
WORKERS
CITED
SEVEN
NEGATIVE
ASPECTS
OF
THEIR
WORK
THINGS
THEY
THOUGHT
OF
AS
PRODUCTIVITY
LIMITERS
OF
THESE
THE
FIRST
FOUR
WERE
NOISE
RELATED
AS
PEOPLE
BEGIN
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THEY
AREN
T
ALONE
IN
THEIR
FEEL
INGS
ENVIRONMENTAL
AWARENESS
INCREASES
AND
WITH
THIS
INCREASED
AWARENESS
TWO
GOOD
THINGS
BEGIN
TO
HAPPEN
FIRST
THE
ENVIRON
MENT
IMPROVES
A
BIT
AS
PEOPLE
TRY
TO
BE
MORE
THOUGHTFUL
ABOUT
NOISE
AND
INTERRUPTION
AND
SECOND
THE
CONSENT
OF
THE
VICTIM
IS
WITH
DRAWN
IT
NOW
BECOMES
HARDER
FOR
UPPER
MANAGEMENT
TO
TAKE
ANY
OTHER
STEP
TO
IMPROVE
PRODUCTIVITY
WITHOUT
FIRST
PAYING
SOME
ATTEN
TION
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENT
DON
T
EXPECT
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
TO
ROLL
OVER
AND
PLAY
DEAD
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
BEGIN
YOUR
CAMPAIGN
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
THREE
COUNTER
ARGUMENTS
BOUND
TO
SURFACE
ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY
PEOPLE
DON
T
CARE
ABOUT
GLITZY
OFFICE
SPACE
THEY
RE
TOO
INTELLIGENT
FOR
THAT
AND
THE
ONES
WHO
DO
CARE
ARE
JUST
PLAYING
STATUS
GAMES
MAYBE
NOISE
IS
A
PROBLEM
BUT
THERE
ARE
CHEAPER
WAYS
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
THAN
MUCKING
AROUND
WITH
THE
PHYSICAL
LAYOUT
WE
COULD
JUST
PIPE
IN
WHITE
NOISE
OR
MUZAK
AND
COVER
UP
THE
DISTURBANCE
ENCLOSED
OFFICES
DON
T
MAKE
FOR
A
VITAL
ENVIRONMENT
WE
WANT
PEOPLE
TO
INTERACT
PRODUCTIVELY
AND
THAT
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TOO
SO
WALLS
AND
DOORS
WOULD
BE
A
STEP
IN
THE
WRONG
DIRECTION
BRING
BACK
THE
DOOR
WE
DEAL
WITH
THESE
OBJECTIONS
IN
THE
NEXT
THREE
SUBSECTIONS
THE
ISSUE
OF
GLITZ
IT
TRUE
THAT
PEOPLE
DON
T
CARE
MUCH
ABOUT
GLITZ
IN
ONE
STUDY
AFTER
ANOTHER
WORKERS
FAILED
TO
GIVE
MUCH
WEIGHT
TO
DECOR
IN
CHOOSING
FOR
INSTANCE
AMONG
VARIOUSLY
COLORED
PANELS
AND
FIXTURES
THE
FEELING
SEEMED
TO
BE
THAT
DEPRESSING
SURROUNDINGS
WOULD
BE
COUN
TERPRODUCTIVE
BUT
AS
LONG
AS
THE
OFFICE
WASN
T
DEPRESSING
THEN
YOU
COULD
HAPPILY
IGNORE
IT
AND
GET
DOWN
TO
WORK
IF
ALL
WE
RE
SHOOTING
FOR
IS
AN
IGNORABLE
WORKPLACE
THEN
MONEY
SPENT
ON
HIGH
FASHION
DECOR
IS
A
WASTE
THE
FACT
THAT
WORKERS
DON
T
CARE
A
LOT
ABOUT
APPEARANCES
IS
OFTEN
MISINTERPRETED
TO
MEAN
THAT
THEY
DON
T
CARE
A
LOT
ABOUT
ANY
OF
THE
ATTRIBUTES
OF
THE
WORKPLACE
IF
YOU
ASK
THEM
SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT
NOISE
PRIVACY
AND
TABLE
SPACE
THOUGH
YOU
LL
HEAR
SOME
STRONGLY
FELT
OPINIONS
THAT
THESE
CHARACTERISTICS
MATTER
A
LOT
THIS
FINDING
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
IGNORABLE
WORKPLACE
AS
IDEAL
ONE
CAN
T
IGNORE
A
WORKPLACE
THAT
IS
FOREVER
INTERRUPTING
PAGING
AND
GENER
ALLY
HARASSING
THE
WORKER
WE
FIND
IT
PARTICULARLY
DISTRESSING
TO
HEAR
WORKERS
CONCERNS
ABOUT
THEIR
ENVIRONMENT
DISMISSED
AS
STATUS
SEEKING
BECAUSE
IT
MORE
OFTEN
THE
CASE
THAT
HIGHER
MANAGEMENT
IS
GUILTY
OF
STATUS
SEEK
ING
IN
DESIGNING
THE
WORKERS
SPACE
THE
PERSON
WHO
IS
WORKING
HARD
TO
DELIVER
A
HIGH
QUALITY
PRODUCT
ON
TIME
IS
NOT
CONCERNED
WITH
OFFICE
APPEARANCES
BUT
THE
BOSS
SOMETIMES
IS
SO
WE
SEE
THE
PARA
DOXICAL
PHENOMENON
THAT
TOTALLY
UNWORKABLE
SPACE
IS
GUSSIED
UP
EXPENSIVELY
AND
POINTLESSLY
WITH
PLUSH
CARPETS
BLACK
AND
CHROME
FURNITURE
CORN
PLANTS
THAT
GET
MORE
SPACE
THAN
WORKERS
AND
ELABO
RATE
PANELS
THE
NEXT
TIME
SOMEONE
PROUDLY
SHOWS
YOU
AROUND
A
NEWLY
DESIGNED
OFFICE
THINK
HARD
ABOUT
WHETHER
IT
THE
FUNC
TIONALITY
OF
THE
SPACE
THAT
IS
BEING
TOUTED
OR
ITS
APPEARANCE
ALL
TOO
OFTEN
IT
THE
APPEARANCE
APPEARANCE
IS
STRESSED
FAR
TOO
MUCH
IN
WORKPLACE
DESIGN
WHAT
IS
MORE
RELEVANT
IS
WHETHER
THE
WORKPLACE
LETS
YOU
WORK
OR
INHIBITS
YOU
WORK
CONDUCIVE
OFFICE
SPACE
IS
NOT
A
STATUS
SYMBOL
IT
A
NECESSITY
EITHER
YOU
PAY
FOR
IT
BY
SHELLING
OUT
WHAT
IT
COSTS
OR
YOU
PAY
FOR
IT
IN
LOST
PRODUCTIVITY
PEOPLEWARE
CREATIVE
SPACE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
WORKERS
GRIPES
ABOUT
NOISE
YOU
CAN
EITHER
TREAT
THE
SYMPTOM
OR
TREAT
THE
CAUSE
TREATING
THE
CAUSE
MEANS
CHOOSING
ISO
LATION
IN
THE
FORM
OF
NOISE
BARRIERS
WALLS
AND
DOORS
AND
THESE
COST
MONEY
TREATING
THE
SYMPTOM
IS
MUCH
CHEAPER
WHEN
YOU
INSTALL
MUZAK
OR
SOME
OTHER
FORM
OF
PINK
NOISE
THE
DISRUPTIVE
NOISE
IS
DROWNED
OUT
AT
SMALL
EXPENSE
YOU
CAN
SAVE
EVEN
MORE
MONEY
BY
IGNORING
THE
PROBLEM
ALTOGETHER
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
RESORT
TO
TAPE
RECORDERS
AND
EARPHONES
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
FROM
THE
NOISE
IF
YOU
TAKE
EITHER
OF
THESE
APPROACHES
YOU
SHOULD
EXPECT
TO
INCUR
AN
INVISIBLE
PENALTY
IN
ONE
ASPECT
OF
WORKERS
PERFORMANCE
THEY
WILL
BE
LESS
CREATIVE
DURING
THE
RESEARCHERS
AT
CORNELL
UNIVERSITY
CONDUCTED
A
SERIES
OF
TESTS
ON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
WORKING
WITH
MUSIC
THEY
POLLED
A
GROUP
OF
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
STUDENTS
AND
DIVIDED
THE
STUDENTS
INTO
TWO
GROUPS
THOSE
WHO
LIKED
TO
HAVE
MUSIC
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
WHILE
THEY
WORKED
STUDIED
AND
THOSE
WHO
DID
NOT
THEN
THEY
PUT
HALF
OF
EACH
GROUP
TOGETHER
IN
A
SILENT

AND
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
EACH
GROUP
IN
A
DIFFERENT
ROOM
EQUIPPED
WITH

AND
A

WITH

THE
PART
OF
THE

IS
UNBOTHERED
BY

THERE
ANOTHER

THAT

HOWEVER

A

THROUGH
A

OF

SO
ON
PERHAPS
COMPLETING
A

ALTHOUGH
THE

NEVER

IT
THE
NET
EFFECT
OF

THAT

BUT
NOT

OF

IS
CEN
BRING
BACK
THE

THERE
IS
THAT
OCCASIONAL
BREAKTHROUGH
THAT

YOU
SAY
AHAH

YOU
TOWARD
AN
INGENIOUS

THE

THE

THE

WE

THE

OVER

THE

PEOPLE
GRIND

AND
THE

LEAVE

THE

SOONER

GETS
AROUND
TO
THE
STERILITY
OF
WORKING

BUT
ENCLOSED
OFFICES
NEED
NOT

OFFICES
THE
TWO

THREE
OR
FOUR
PERSON
OFFICE
MAKES
A

MORE
SENSE
PARTICULARLY
IF
OFFICE

CAN

TO

THE
WORKER
WHO
NEEDS
TO
SPEND
FIFTY
PERCENT
OF
HIS

WITH

WILL
SPEND
MOST
OF
THAT

WITH

THESE
TWO
ARE
NATURAL
CANDIDATES
TO
SHARE
AN
OFFICE
EVEN
IN

WORKERS
SHOULD
BE
ENCOURAGED
TO
MODIFY
THE
GRID
TO
PUT
THEIR

TOGETHER
INTO

WHEN

IN

OUT
THE

THEY

CLASH
WITH

THE

HAS
A
VITAL
QUALITY
BECAUSE

IS

NATURAL
A
DEGREE
OF

OVER
THEIR

IS
VIEWED
AS
AN
ADDITIONAL

BREAKING
THE

THAN
A

ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
BENEFITS
OF
THE
KIND
OF

THAT

THAT

PURCHASED
IS
ITS

AT

THAT

SEEM
NONTHREATENING
BUT
WE
PREDICT
THAT
SOMEONE
IN
THE
UPPER
REACHES
OF
THE
ORGANIZATION
WILL
HATE
THE
IDEA
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
HALLOWED
PRINCIPLE
OF
UNIFORMITY
IS
VIOLATED
BY
MAKING
EVERYTHING
UNIFORM
THE
OWNER
OF
A
TERRITORY
EXERCISES
AND
DEMONSTRATES

LIKE
THE

WHO

UNDER

SO
THAT

THIS

THREATENED
BY
THE
KIND
OF

THAT
NATURE
IN
THIS

HUMAN
NATURE
PREFERS
THE
INCONVENIENT
FACT
OF

IS
THAT
THE

NOT

INFINITELY
REPLICABLE
VITAL
WORK
CONDUCIVE
SPACE
FOR

IF
YOU

YOUR

THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
IT
WON

BE

EACH

EACH

A
DEFINITE

IF

THEY

MANAGEMENT
AT

SURE
THERE

SO
THAT

CAN
CREATE
THEIR

SENSIBLE

UNIFORMITY
HAS
NO

IN
THIS
VIEW
YOU
HAVE
TO
GRIN
AND
BEAR
IT
WHEN

PUT

A

OR

WE
LOOK
INTO

TRYING

SUCH
AS
THESE
WHAT
KIND
OF

WOULD
SUPPORT
YOUR

TO
MAKE

HAPPY
AND
PRODUCTIVE
WHAT
FORM
OF

WOULD
MAKE
THESE

FEEL

ABOUT
THEMSELVES
AND
ABOUT
THEIR

IF
YOU
WORK
IN
A
TYPICAL
NOISY
AND
DREADFULLY
UNIFORM

SUCH
QUESTIONS
MAY
SEEM
ALMOST
CRUEL
BUT
THINK

ABOUT

IS
WORTHWHILE
SOMEDAY
YOU
MAY
BE
IN
A

IT
HAPPEN
EVEN
TODAY
YOU
MAY
BE
CALLED
UPON
TO
PROVIDE
SOME

JUST
TO

WHERE
YOU
OUGHT
TO

WHERE
YOU
OUGHT
TO
BE

IN
OUR
OPINION
IS
TOWARD
A
WORKSPACE
THAT
HAS
CERTAIN
TIME
PROVEN
CHARACTERISTICS
THERE
IS
ONE
TIMELESS
WAY
OF
BUILDING
IT
IS
THOUSANDS

THE

TODAY
AS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN

WHERE
YOU

BY

ARCHITECTS
ARE
UNDERSTANDABLY
A
BIT
DEFENSIVE
ABOUT
THE
MAN
AND
HIS
IDEAS
BUT
WHEN
YOU
HOLD
THESE
BOOKS
IN
YOUR
OWN
HANDS
AND
EXAMINE
THEIR
PREMISES
AGAINST
YOUR
OWN
EXPERIENCE
IT
HARD
NOT
TO
TAKE
ALEXANDER
SIDE
HIS
PHILOSOPHY
OF
INTERIOR
SPACE
IS
A
COMPELLING
ONE
IT
HELPS
YOU
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
IT
IS
THAT
HAS
MADE
YOU
LOVE
CERTAIN
SPACES
AND
NEVER
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
IN
OTHERS
ALEXANDER
CONCEPT
OF
ORGANIC
ORDER
IMAGINE
THAT
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
IS
ABOUT
TO
BUILD
A
COMPLEX
OF
NEW
SPACE
WHAT
IS
THE
FIRST
STEP
IN
THIS
PROCESS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
MASTER
PLAN
IN
MOST
CASES
THIS
IS
A
FIRST
AND
FATAL
DEVIATION
FROM
THE
TIMELESS
WAY
OF
BUILDING
VITAL
EXCITING
AND
HARMONIOUS
SPACES
ARE
NEVER
DEVELOPED
THIS
WAY
THE

AND
GRANDEUR
STEEL
AND
CONCRETE
SPANS
MODULAR
APPROACHES
AND
REPLICATION
TO
MAKE
AN
ENORMOUS
WHOLE
OF

THE
RESULT
IS
STERILE
UNIFORMITY
AND
SPACE
THAT
DOESN
T
WORK
FOR
ANYONE
EXCEPT
THE
ONE
EGO
TO
WHOM
IT
STANDS
AS
A
TRIBUTE
TAKING
UMBRELLA

MOST
MONOLITHIC
CORPORATE

CAN
ONLY
BE
UNDERSTOOD
IN
TERMS
OF
ITS

THEY
LEAVE

THEY
GLOAT

DESPAIR

IT
IS

OR

THE
RESULT
IS
DEPRESSINGLY
THE
SAME
A
SENSE
OF
SUFFOCATION
TO
THE
INDI
VIDUAL
THE
MASTER
PLAN
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
IMPOSE
TOTALITARIAN
ORDER
A
SINGLE
AND
THEREFORE
UNIFORM
VISION
GOVERNS
THE
WHOLE
IN
NO
TWO
PLACES
IS
THE
SAME
FUNCTION
ACHIEVED
DIFFERENTLY
A
SIDE
EFFECT
OF
THE
TOTALITARIAN
VIEW
IS
THAT
THE
CONCEPTUALIZATION
OF
THE
FACILITY
IS
FROZEN
IN
TIME
IN
PLACE
OF
THE
MASTER
PLAN
ALEXANDER
PROPOSES
A

IT
IS
A
PHILOSOPHY
BY
WHICH
A

CAN
GROW
IN
AN
EVOLUTIONARY

TO
ACHIEVE
THE

OF
ITS
OCCUPANTS
THE

HAS
THREE
PARTS
A
PHILOSOPHY
OF

THROUGH
A

OF

INTO

OF

BY
RESPECTING
THE
SHARED

THEY
RETAIN
A
HARMONY
OF

BUT
NOT
A

LIKE
MATURE

THEY
BEGIN
TO
TAKE
ON
AN
EVOLVED
CHARM
THIS
IS
WHAT
ALEXANDER
CALLS
ORGANIC

AS
DESCRIBED
BELOW
AND
AS
SHOWN
IN

THIS
NATURAL

EMERGES
WHEN
THERE
IS

THE

ARE

RE

BECAUSE
THAT
SMALL
LONELY
SPACE
EXCLUDES
EVERYONE
BUT
YOU
IT
KIND
OF
A
TOILET
STALL
WITHOUT
A

THE
SPACE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
WORK
ALONE
AND
ALMOST
IM
POSSIBLE
TO

IN
THE
SOCIAL

THAT

YOUR

GIVE
POOR

THE

WE

THAT
JUST
ISN

SURE
IT

IS
A
PERFECT

THAT
SUFFICIENT

CAN

IS

THIS
IS
FOR

YOU
RE
ONLY

SO
HOTELS
ARE
CONSTRUCTED
WITH

THE
PROBLEM
OF

IS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
A
SQUARE
ASPECT

IF

FAIRLY

THERE

THIS

WHAT
ABOUT
COSTS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
ECONOMIES
OF
SCALE
THAT
COME
WITH
BUILDING
ENORMOUS
INDOOR
SPACES
SOME
YEARS
AGO
THE
DANISH
LEGISLATURE
PASSED
A
LAW
THAT
EVERY

MUST
HAVE
HIS

THIS
LAW
HAS
FORCED

TO
CONSTRUCT
LONG
NARROW

IN

CONDUCTED

THE

THAT

IF
THERE
IS
A

PER

TO

IN

THE
ADDED
EXPENSE
IS
LIKELY
TO
MAKE
GOOD
SENSE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SAVINGS
IT
PROVIDES
IN
OTHER
AREAS
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
COST
IS
IN
A
HIGHLY

THE

YOU
DON

FOR
A

IN
WHICH
CHARMING

IDIOSYNCRATIC
WORKPLACES
OCCUR
RATHER
NATURALLY
THERE
IS
NONETHELESS
A
POSSIBLE
WAY
TO
PUT
YOUR

INTO
VITAL
PRODUCTIVE
SPACE
THE
POSSIBILITY
ARISES
BECAUSE
MASTER
PLANNED
SPACE
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
FULL
AND
IT
A
CONTINUAL
HASSLE
TO
FIND
A
PLACE
TO
HOUSE
ANY
NEW

IF
YOU
RUN
ONE
OF
THOSE
AS

TURN
YOUR

OUTWARD
PETITION
TO
MOVE
YOUR

OUT
OF
THE

MONOLITH
YOU
MAY
BE
TURNED
DOWN
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
SINCE
THERE
NO
SPACE
FOR
YOU
IN

YOU
MAY
NOT
PUT
YOUR

TO

AND
ARRANGE
THEIR

NEVER
MIND
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
HAVE
THE

WHITE

OR
CORDUROY

AS

SPACE
IF
YOU
CAN
PICK
UP
A

ON
A

DOWN
FRATERNITY
HOUSE
OR

APARTMENT
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
CHEAP
IDIOSYNCRATIC
FASCINATING

FOR

THEN
SO
WHAT
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
HOUSED
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
EVERYONE
ELSE
IN

IF
IT

WITH

WHO

YOU
DON

FOR

IF

JUST
FOR

YOU
RE

AHEAD
AND
IF
YOUR

IS
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
AND
HAS
LOWER

THAT
JUST
PROVES
YOU
RE
A
BETTER

IT
ALMOST
ALWAYS
MAKES

TO
MOVE
A

OUT
OF

GOT

THE

A

IF

IT

TRUE

THE

THAT

AND
IT
CERTAINLY
IS

IT
DOESN

VERY
REALISTIC
TO

PARENTS
DO
HAVE
A
SHAPING
EFFECT
ON
THEIR

OVER
THE

AND
INDIVIDUALS
CAN
OBVIOUSLY
BRING
ABOUT
HUGE
CHANGES
IN

BUT
MANAGERS
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
CHANGE
THEIR

IN
ANY
MEANINGFUL
WAY
PEOPLE
USUALLY
DON

STAY
PUT
LONG
ENOUGH
AND
THE

JUST
DOESN
T
HAVE
ENOUGH
LEVERAGE
TO
MAKE
A

IN

SO
THE

WHO
WORK
FOR

THROUGH

WILL
BE

AS
THEY

IF
THEY

THEY
NEVER

BE
ALL
OF
THIS
MEANS
THAT
GETTING

YOU
DON

THAT

HIRING

FROM

THIS
IS
NOT

DUE
TO
IGNORANCE

ON
THE

YOU

THE

HE

LEARNS
TO
OVERRIDE
THE

TOWARD
THE

IN
SELECTING
FRIENDS
AND

CLOSE

THOUGH
YOU
MAY
HAVE
LEARNED
THAT
LESSON
LONG

IN
YOUR
PERSONAL
LIFE
YOU
HAVE
TO
LEARN
IT
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
AS
YOU
DEVELOP
YOUR

YOU
PROBABLY
DON
T
FEEL
THAT
YOU
HAVE
AN
UNCONTROLLABLE
TEN
DENCY
TO

ATTRACTIVE

SO
WHY
ARE
WE

ABOUT
THIS
AT

BECAUSE
IT
NOT

IN

THIS

CAN
BE

WHEN

IT
DIFFICULT

TO

THE

WHO

MOST
THE

THESE
ARE
NOT

AS

THEY

THE

THE

PRODUCE
A
PRODUCT
PRESUMABLY
SIM
ILAR
TO
THOSE
HE
OR
SHE
HAS
MADE
BEFORE
YOU
NEED
TO
EXAMINE
A
SAMPLE
OF
THOSE
PRODUCTS
TO
SEE
THE
QUALITY
OF
WORK
THE
CANDIDATE
DOES
THAT
MAY
SEEM
OBVIOUS
BUT
IT
ALMOST
ALWAYS
OVERLOOKED
BY
DEVELOPMENT
MANAGERS
THERE
IS
A
SURFACE
RESERVE
AT
WORK
WHEN
YOU
MEET
FOR
A
JOB
INTERVIEW
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
UNWRITTEN
RALE
THAT
SAYS
IT
OKAY
TO
ASK
THE
CANDIDATE
ABOUT
PAST
WORK
BUT
NOT
TO
ASK
TO
SEE
IT
YET
WHEN
YOU
ASK
CANDIDATES
ARE
ALMOST
ALWAYS
PLEASED
TO
BRING
ALONG
A
SAMPLE
THE
PORTFOLIO
IN
THE
SPRING
OF
WHILE
TEACHING
TOGETHER
IN
WESTERN
CANADA
WE
GOT
A
CALL
FROM
A
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
LOCAL
TECHNICAL
COLLEGE
HE
PROPOSED
TO
STOP
BY
OUR
HOTEL
AFTER
CLASS
ONE
EVENING
AND
BUY
US
BEERS
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
IDEAS
THAT
THE
KIND
OF
OFFER
WE
SELDOM
TURN
DOWN
WHAT
WE
LEARNED
FROM
HIM
THAT
EVENING
WAS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
WORTH
MORE
THAN
WHATEVER
HE
LEARNED
FROM
US
THE
TEACHER
WAS
CANDID
ABOUT
WHAT
HE
NEEDED
TO
BE
JUDGED
A
SUCCESS
IN
HIS
WORK
HE
NEEDED
HIS
STUDENTS
TO
GET
GOOD
JOB
OFFERS
AND
LOTS
OF
THEM
A
HARVARD
DIPLOMA
IS
WORTH
SOMETHING
IN
AND
OF
ITSELF
BUT
OUR
DIPLOMA
ISN
T
WORTH
SQUAT
IF
THIS
YEAR
GRADUATES
DON
T
GET
HIRED
FAST
THERE
ARE
NO
STUDENTS
NEXT
YEAR
AND
I
M
OUT
OF
A
JOB
SO
HE
HAD
DEVELOPED
A
FORMULA
TO
MAKE
HIS
GRADUATES
OPTI
MALLY
ATTRACTIVE
TO
THE
JOB
MARKET
OF
COURSE
HE
TAUGHT
THEM
MODERN
TECHNIQUES
FOR
SYSTEM
CONSTRUCTION
INCLUDING
STRUCTURED
ANALYSIS
AND
DESIGN
DATA
DRIVEN
DESIGN
INFORMATION
HIDING
STRUCTURED
COD
ING
WALKTHROUGHS
AND
METRICS
HE
ALSO
HAD
THEM
WORK
ON
REAL
APPLICATIONS
FOR
NEARBY
COMPANIES
AND
AGENCIES
BUT
THE
CENTERPIECE
OF
HIS
FORMULA
WAS
THE
PORTFOLIO
THAT
ALL
STUDENTS
PUT
TOGETHER
TO
SHOW
SAMPLES
OF
THEIR
WORK
HE
DESCRIBED
HOW
HIS
STUDENTS
HAD
BEEN
COACHED
TO
SHOW
OFF
THEIR
PORTFOLIOS
AS
PART
OF
EACH
INTERVIEW
I
VE
BROUGHT
ALONG
SOME
SAMPLES
OF
THE
KIND
OF
WORK
I
DO
HERE
FOR
INSTANCE
IS
A
SUBROUTINE
IN
PASCAL
FROM
ONE
PROJECT
AND
A
SET
OF
COBOL
PARAGRAPHS
FROM
ANOTHER
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
IN
THIS
PORTION
WE
USE
THE
LOOP
WITH
EXIT
EXTENSION
ADVOCATED
BY
KNUTH
BUT
ASIDE
FROM
THAT
IT
PURE
STRUCTURED
CODE
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SORT
OF
THING
THAT
YOUR
COMPANY
STANDARD
CALLS
FOR
AND
HERE
IS
THE
DESIGN
THAT
THIS
CODE
WAS
WRITTEN
FROM
THE
HIERARCHIES
AND
PEOPLEWARE
COUPLING
ANALYSIS
USE
MYERS
NOTATION
I
DESIGNED
ALL
OF
THIS
PARTICULAR
SUBSYSTEM
AND
THIS
ONE
LITTLE
SECTION
WHERE
WE
USED
SOME
ORR
METHODS
BECAUSE
THE
DATA
STRUCTURE
REALLY
IMPOSED
ITSELF
ON
THE
PROCESS
STRUCTURE
AND
THESE
ARE
THE
LEVELED
DATA
FLOW
DIAGRAMS
THAT
MAKE
UP
THE
GUTS
OF
OUR
SPECIFICATION
AND
THE
ASSOCIATED
DATA
DICTIONARY
IN
THE
YEARS
SINCE
WE
VE
OFTEN
HEARD
MORE
ABOUT
THAT
OBSCURE
TECHNICAL
COLLEGE
AND
THOSE
PORTFOLIOS
WE
VE
MET
RECRUITERS
FROM
AS
FAR
AWAY
AS
TRIANGLE
PARK
NORTH
CAROLINA
AND
TAMPA
FLORIDA
WHO
REGULARLY
CONVERGE
UPON
THAT
DISTANT
CANADIAN
CAMPUS
FOR
A
SHOT
AT
ITS
GRADUATES
OF
COURSE
THIS
WAS
A
CLEVER
SCHEME
OF
THE
PROFESSOR
TO
GIVE
ADDED
ALLURE
TO
HIS
GRADUATES
BUT
WHAT
STRUCK
US
MOST
THAT
EVENING
WAS
THE
REPORT
THAT
INTERVIEWERS
WERE
ALWAYS
SURPRISED
BY
THE
PORT
FOLIOS
THAT
MEANT
THEY
WEREN
T
REGULARLY
REQUIRING
ALL
CANDIDATES
TO
ARRIVE
WITH
PORTFOLIOS
YET
WHY
NOT
WHAT
COULD
BE
MORE
SENSIBLE
THAN
ASKING
EACH
CANDIDATE
TO
BRING
ALONG
SOME
SAMPLES
OF
WORK
TO
THE
INTERVIEW
APTITUDE
TESTS
IF
IT
SO
IMPORTANT
THAT
THE
NEW
HIRE
BE
GOOD
AT
THE
VARIOUS
SKILLS
USED
IN
THE
JOB
WHY
NOT
DESIGN
AN
APTITUDE
TEST
TO
MEASURE
THOSE
SKILLS
OUR
INDUSTRY
HAS
HAD
A
LONG
IRREGULAR
FLIRTATION
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
APTITUDE
TESTING
IN
THE
SIXTIES
THE
IDEA
WAS
POSITIVELY
IN
VOGUE
BY
NOW
YOU
AND
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
HAVE
PROBABLY
GIVEN
UP
ON
THE
CONCEPT
IN
CASE
YOU
HAVEN
T
WE
OFFER
ONE
GOOD
REASON
THAT
YOU
OUGHT
TO
THE
TESTS
MEASURE
THE
WRONG
THING
APTITUDE
TESTS
ARE
ALMOST
ALWAYS
ORIENTED
TOWARD
THE
TASKS
THE
PERSON
WILL
PERFORM
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
BEING
HIRED
THEY
TEST
WHETHER
HE
OR
SHE
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
GOOD
AT
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
OR
PRO
GRAMMING
OR
WHATEVER
IT
IS
THAT
REQUIRED
IN
THE
POSITION
YOU
CAN
BUY
APTITUDE
TESTS
IN
VIRTUALLY
ANY
TECHNICAL
AREA
AND
THEY
ALL
TEND
TO
HAVE
FAIRLY
RESPECTABLE
TRACK
RECORDS
AT
PREDICTING
HOW
WELL
THE
NEW
HIRE
WILL
PERFORM
BUT
SO
WHAT
A
SUCCESSFUL
NEW
HIRE
MIGHT
DO
THOSE
TASKS
FOR
A
FEW
YEARS
AND
THEN
MOVE
ON
TO
BE
TEAM
LEADER
OR
A
PRODUCT
MANAGER
OR
A
PROJECT
HEAD
THAT
PERSON
MIGHT
END
UP
DOING
THE
TASKS
THAT
THE
TEST
MEASURED
FOR
TWO
YEARS
AND
THEN
DO
OTHER
THINGS
FOR
TWENTY
HIRING
A
JUGGLER
THE
APTITUDE
TESTS
WE
VE
SEEN
ARE
MOSTLY
LEFT
BRAIN
ORIENTED
THAT
BECAUSE
THE
TYPICAL
THINGS
NEW
HIRES
DO
ARE
PERFORMED
LARGELY
IN
THE
LEFT
BRAIN
THE
THINGS
THEY
DO
LATER
ON
IN
THEIR
CAREER
HOW
EVER
ARE
TO
A
MUCH
GREATER
DEGREE
RIGHT
BRAIN
ACTIVITIES
MAN
AGEMENT
IN
PARTICULAR
REQUIRES
HOLISTIC
THINKING
HEURISTIC
JUDGMENT
AND
INTUITION
BASED
UPON
EXPERIENCE
SO
THE
APTITUDE
TEST
MAY
GIVE
YOU
PEOPLE
WHO
PERFORM
BETTER
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
BUT
ARE
LESS
LIKELY
TO
SUCCEED
LATER
ON
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
USE
AN
APTITUDE
TEST
BUT
HIRE
ONLY
THOSE
WHO
FAIL
IT
FROM
YOUR
READING
OF
THIS
BOOK
YOU
D
HARDLY
EXPECT
ITS
AUTHORS
TO
ENDORSE
THE
IDEA
OF
HIRING
THROUGH
THE
USE
OF
APTITUDE
TESTS
BUT
IT
DOESN
T
FOLLOW
THAT
APTITUDE
TESTS
ARE
NO
GOOD
OR
THAT
YOU
OUGHT
NOT
TO
BE
USING
THEM
YOU
SHOULD
USE
THEM
JUST
NOT
FOR
HIRING
THE
TYPICAL
APTITUDE
TEST
YOU
BUY
OR
BUILD
CAN
BE
A
WONDERFUL
SELF
ASSESSMENT
VEHICLE
FOR
YOUR
PEOPLE
FREQUENT
INTERESTING
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
PRIVATE
SELF
ASSESSMENT
ARE
A
MUST
FOR
WORKERS
IN
A
HEALTHY
ORGANIZATION
MORE
ABOUT
THIS
IN
CHAPTER
HOLDING
AN
AUDITION
THE
BUSINESS
WE
RE
IN
IS
MORE
SOCIOLOGICAL
THAN
TECHNOLOGICAL
MORE
DEPENDENT
ON
WORKERS
ABILITIES
TO
COMMUNICATE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
THAN
THEIR
ABILITIES
TO
COMMUNICATE
WITH
MACHINES
SO
THE
HIRING
PROCESS
NEEDS
TO
FOCUS
ON
AT
LEAST
SOME
SOCIOLOGICAL
AND
HUMAN
COMMU
NICATION
TRAITS
THE
BEST
WAY
WE
VE
DISCOVERED
TO
DO
THIS
IS
THROUGH
THE
USE
OF
AUDITIONS
FOR
JOB
CANDIDATES
THE
IDEA
IS
SIMPLE
ENOUGH
YOU
ASK
A
CANDIDATE
TO
PREPARE
A
TEN
OR
FIFTEEN
MINUTE
PRESENTATION
ON
SOME
ASPECT
OF
PAST
WORK
IT
COULD
BE
ABOUT
A
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
AND
THE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
FIRST
TRYING
IT
OUT
OR
ABOUT
A
MANAGEMENT
LESSON
LEARNED
THE
HARD
WAY
OR
ABOUT
A
PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING
PROJECT
THE
CANDIDATE
CHOOSES
DIE
SUBJECT
THE
DATE
IS
SET
AND
YOU
ASSEMBLE
A
SMALL
AUDIENCE
MADE
UP
OF
THOSE
WHO
WILL
BE
THE
NEW
HIRE
CO
WORKERS
OF
COURSE
THE
CANDIDATE
WILL
BE
NERVOUS
PERHAPS
EVEN
RELUC
TANT
TO
UNDERTAKE
SUCH
AN
EXPERIENCE
YOU
LL
HAVE
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
ALL
CANDIDATES
ARE
NERVOUS
ABOUT
THE
AUDITION
AND
GIVE
YOUR
REASONS
FOR
HOLDING
ONE
TO
SEE
THE
VARIOUS
CANDIDATES
COMMUNICATION
SKILLS
AND
TO
GIVE
THE
FUTURE
CO
WORKERSA
PART
IN
THE
HIRING
PROCESS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
AUDITION
AND
AFTER
THE
CANDIDATE
HAS
LEFT
YOU
HOLD
A
DEBRIEFING
OF
THOSE
PRESENT
EACH
ONE
GETS
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
PERSON
SUITABILITY
FOR
THE
JOB
AND
WHETHER
HE
OR
SHE
SEEMS
LIKELY
TO
FIT
WELL
INTO
THE
TEAM
ALTHOUGH
IT
ULTIMATELY
YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
PEOPLEWARE
DECIDE
WHETHER
TO
HIRE
OR
NOT
THE
FEEDBACK
FROM
FUTURE
CO
WORKERS
CAN
BE
INVALUABLE
EVEN
MORE
IMPORTANT
ANY
NEW
PERSON
HIRED
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
ACCEPTED
SMOOTHLY
INTO
THE
GROUP
SINCE
THE
OTHER
GROUP
MEMBERS
HAVE
HAD
A
VOICE
IN
CHOOSING
THE
CANDIDATE
MY
FIRST
EXPERIENCE
WITH
AUDITIONS
WAS
IN
HIRING
PEO
PLE
TO
BE
CONSULTANTS
AND
INSTRUCTORS
MY
MOTIVATION
IN
TORTURING
THESE
PROSPECTIVE
HIRES
WAS
SIMPLE
ENOUGH
I
WANTED
TO
GET
A
SENSE
OF
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
NATURAL
EXPLAINERS
OF
MATTERS
SIMPLE
OR
COMPLEX
OR
PEOPLE
WHO
COULD
BE
TAUGHT
TO
EXPLAIN
SUCH
MATTERS
OR
THOSE
WHO
COULD
NEVER
EXPLAIN
ANYTHING
TO
ANYONE
I
ALSO
WANTED
SOME
SECOND
OPINIONS
ON
THE
MATTER
SO
I
HAD
THOSE
OF
MY
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
THE
OFFICE
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
AUDITION
SIT
IN
ON
THE
PRESENTATION
OVER
FIVE
YEARS
WE
CONDUCTED
NEARLY
TWO
HUNDRED
AUDITIONS
IT
SOON
BECAME
CLEAR
THAT
THE
AUDITION
PROCESS
SERVED
TO
ACCELERATE
THE
SOCIALIZATION
PROCESS
BETWEEN
A
NEW
HIRE
AND
THE
EXISTING
STAFF
MEMBERS
A
SUCCESSFUL
AUDITION
WAS
A
KIND
OF
CERTIFICATION
AS
A
PEER
THE
REVERSE
SEEMED
TO
HOLD
TRUE
AS
WELL
FAILED
AUDITIONS
WERE
A
MORALE
BOOSTER
FOR
THE
STAFF
THEY
WERE
CONTINUING
PROOF
THAT
BEING
HIRED
FOR
THE
GROUP
WAS
MORE
THAN
JUST
THE
DUMB
LUCK
OF
WHEN
RESUMES
HAPPENED
TO
HIT
MY
DESK
TRL
ONE
CAVEAT
ABOUT
AUDITIONS
MAKE
SURE
THE
CANDIDATE
SPEAKS
ABOUT
SOMETHING
IMMEDIATELY
GERMANE
TO
THE
WORK
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
DOES
IT
EASY
TO
BE
SNOOKERED
BY
A
TALK
ON
A
TOPIC
FROM
EXTREME
LEFT
FIELD
LIKE
CARING
FOR
THE
AUTISTIC
CHILD
OR
EFFECTS
OF
ACID
RAIN
YOU
RE
LIABLE
TO
CATCH
A
GLIMPSE
OF
A
VERY
COMPELLING
PAS
SION
ON
THE
SPEAKER
PART
A
PASSION
THAT
YOU
LL
NEVER
SEE
AGAIN
ON
THE
JOB
CHAPTER
HAPPY
TO
BE
HERE
THIS
CHAPTER
BEGINS
WITH
A
POP
QUIZ
QL
WHAT
ANNUAL
EMPLOYEE
TURNOVER
HAS
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
EXPERIENCED
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
HOW
MUCH
DOES
IT
COST
ON
AVERAGE
TO
REPLACE
A
PERSON
WHO
LEAVES
SCORE
YOURSELF
AS
FOLLOWS
IF
YOU
HAD
ANY
ANSWER
AT
ALL
TO
THE
TWO
QUESTIONS
YOU
PASS
OTHERWISE
YOU
FAIL
MOST
PEOPLE
FAIL
IN
ALL
FAIRNESS
PERHAPS
IT
NOT
YOUR
JOB
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
SUCH
THINGS
OKAY
WE
LL
RE
SCORE
YOUR
QUIZ
YOU
PASS
IF
ANYONE
IN
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
HAS
A
REAL
ANSWER
TO
THE
TWO
QUESTIONS
MOST
PEOPLE
STILL
FAIL
WE
AVOID
MEASURING
TURNOVER
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
THAT
HEAVY
SMOKERS
AVOID
HAVING
LONG
SERIOUS
TALKS
WITH
THEIR
DOCTORS
ABOUT
LONGEVITY
IT
A
LOT
OF
BOTHER
THAT
CAN
ONLY
RESULT
IN
BAD
NEWS
TURNOVER
THE
OBVIOUS
COSTS
TYPICAL
TURNOVER
FIGURES
WE
ENCOUNTER
ARE
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
EIGHTY
PERCENT
TO
THIRTY
THREE
PERCENT
PER
YEAR
IMPLYING
AN
AVERAGE
EMPLOYEE
LONGEVITY
OF
FROM
FIFTEEN
TO
THIRTY
SIX
MONTHS
ASSUME
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THAT
THE
TURNOVER
FOR
YOUR
COMPANY
IS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THIS
RANGE
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
LEAVES
AFTER
A
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
TWO
YEARS
IT
COSTS
ONE
AND
A
HALF
TO
TWO
MONTHS
SALARY
TO
HIRE
A
NEW
EMPLOYEE
EITHER
AS
A
FEE
TO
AN
AGENCY
OR
AS
THE
COST
OF
AN
IN
HOUSE
PEOPLEWARE
PERSONNEL
SERVICE
THAT
DOES
THE
SAME
FUNCTION
THE
EMPLOYEE
ONCE
HIRED
MAY
GO
RIGHT
TO
WORK
ON
A
PROJECT
IN
WHICH
CASE
HIS
OR
HER
HOURS
ARE
ALL
BILLED
TO
THE
PROJECT
THERE
IS
NO
INDICATION
OF
STARTUP
COST
THIS
IS
HOWEVER
A
PURE
BOOKKEEPING
FICTION
WE
ALL
KNOW
THAT
A
NEW
EMPLOYEE
IS
QUITE
USELESS
ON
DAY
ONE
OR
EVEN
WORSE
THAN
USELESS
SINCE
SOMEONE
ELSE
TIME
IS
REQUIRED
TO
BEGIN
BRINGING
THE
NEW
PERSON
UP
TO
SPEED
BY
THE
END
OF
A
FEW
MONTHS
THE
NEW
PERSON
IS
DOING
SOME
USEFUL
WORK
WITHIN
FIVE
MONTHS
HE
OR
SHE
IS
AT
FULL
WORKING
CAPACITY
A
REASONABLE
ASSESSMENT
OF
STARTUP
COST
IS
THEREFORE
APPROXIMATELY
THREE
LOST
WORK
MONTHS
PER
NEW
HIRE
OBVIOUSLY
THE
STARTUP
COST
IS
WORSE
OR
MUCH
WORSE
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
THE
WORK
TO
BE
PERFORMED
IS
HIGHLY
ESOTERIC
THE
TOTAL
COST
OF
REPLACING
EACH
PERSON
IS
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
FOUR
AND
A
HALF
TO
FIVE
MONTHS
OF
EMPLOYEE
COST
OR
ABOUT
TWENTY
PERCENT
OF
THE
COST
OF
KEEPING
THAT
EMPLOYEE
FOR
THE
FULL
TWO
YEARS
ON
THE
JOB
TURNOVER
VARIES
ENORMOUSLY
FROM
ONE
ORGANIZATION
TO
ANOTHER
WE
HEAR
OF
COMPANIES
WITH
A
TEN
PERCENT
TURNOVER
AND
OTHERS
IN
THE
SAME
BUSINESS
WITH
A
HUNDRED
PERCENT
OR
HIGHER
TURNOVER
AT
ANY
CHANCE
GATHERING
OF
MANAGERS
FROM
RIVAL
COMPANIES
YOU
CAN
EXPECT
THAT
THE
PERSON
SEATED
NEXT
TO
YOU
HAS
GOT
A
TURNOVER
RATE
THAT
IS
DIF
FERENT
FROM
YOURS
BY
MORE
THAN
A
FACTOR
OF
TWO
OF
COURSE
NEITHER
OF
YOU
KNOWS
WHICH
WAY
THIS
DIFFERENCE
WORKS
AND
YOU
NEVER
WILL
BECAUSE
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
OF
YOU
PROBABLY
WORKS
FOR
A
COMPA
NY
THAT
DOESN
T
MEASURE
TURNOVER
THE
HIDDEN
COSTS
OF
TURNOVER
EMPLOYEE
TURNOVER
COSTS
ABOUT
TWENTY
PERCENT
OF
ALL
MANPOWER
EXPENSE
BUT
THAT
ONLY
THE
VISIBLE
COST
OF
TURNOVER
THERE
IS
AN
UGLY
INVISIBLE
COST
THAT
CAN
BE
FAR
WORSE
IN
COMPANIES
WITH
HIGH
TURNOVER
PEOPLE
TEND
TOWARD
A
DESTRUCTIVELY
SHORT
TERM
VIEWPOINT
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
THEY
JUST
AREN
T
GOING
TO
BE
THERE
VERY
LONG
SO
IF
YOU
FIND
YOURSELF
CAM
PAIGNING
FOR
BETTER
WORKSPACE
FOR
YOUR
STAFF
FOR
EXAMPLE
DON
T
BE
SURPRISED
TO
BUMP
INTO
SOMEONE
UP
THE
HIERARCHY
WHO
COUNTERS
WITH
AN
ARGUMENT
LIKE
THIS
HOLD
ON
THERE
BUSTER
YOU
RE
TALKING
ABOUT
BIG
BUCKS
IF
WE
GAVE
OUR
ENGINEERS
THAT
MUCH
SPACE
AND
NOISE
PRO
TECTION
AND
EVEN
PRIVACY
WE
MIGHT
END
UP
SPENDING
FIFTY
DOLLARS
PER
PERSON
PER
MONTH
MULTIPLY
THAT
TIMES
ALL
THE
HAPPY
TO
BE
HERE
ENGINEERS
AND
YOU
RE
INTO
THE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
DOL
LARS
WE
CAN
T
SPEND
THAT
KIND
OF
MONEY
I
M
AS
MUCH
IN
FAVOR
OF
PRODUCTIVITY
AS
THE
NEXT
GUY
BUT
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
WHAT
A
TERRIBLE
THIRD
QUARTER
WE
RE
HAVING
OF
COURSE
THE
IRREVOCABLY
LOGICAL
ANSWER
TO
THIS
IS
THAT
INVESTING
NOW
IN
A
SENSIBLE
ENVIRONMENT
WILL
HELP
TO
AVOID
TERRIBLE
THIRD
QUAR
TERS
IN
THE
FUTURE
BUT
SAVE
YOUR
BREATH
YOU
HAVE
ENCOUNTERED
A
SHORT
TERM
PERSPECTIVE
THAT
NO
AMOUNT
OF
IRREVOCABLE
LOGIC
IS
GOING
TO
SWAY
THIS
PERSON
IS
ON
HIS
OR
HER
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
COMPANY
THE
SHORT
TERM
COST
IS
VERY
REAL
BUT
THE
LONG
TERM
BENEFIT
HAS
NO
MEAN
ING
WHATSOEVER
IN
AN
ORGANIZATION
WITH
HIGH
TURNOVER
NOBODY
IS
WILLING
TO
TAKE
THE
LONG
VIEW
IF
THE
ORGANIZATION
IS
A
BANK
IT
WILL
LEND
MONEY
TO
THE
UGANDAN
DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION
BECAUSE
THE
TWENTY
TWO
PERCENT
INTEREST
LOOKS
TERRIFIC
ON
THIS
QUARTER
BOOKS
OF
COURSE
THE
UDC
WILL
DEFAULT
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
BUT
WHO
EVEN
GOING
TO
BE
HERE
THEN
IF
THE
ORGANIZATION
IS
A
DEVELOPMENT
SHOP
IT
WILL
OPTI
MIZE
FOR
THE
SHORT
TERM
EXPLOIT
PEOPLE
CHEAT
ON
THE
WORKPLACE
AND
DO
NOTHING
TO
CONSERVE
ITS
VERY
LIFEBLOOD
THE
PEOPLEWARE
THAT
IS
ITS
ONLY
REAL
ASSET
IF
WE
RAN
OUR
AGRICULTURAL
ECONOMY
ON
THE
SAME
BASIS
WE
D
EAT
OUR
SEED
CORN
IMMEDIATELY
AND
ALL
STARVE
NEXT
YEAR
IF
PEOPLE
ONLY
STICK
AROUND
A
YEAR
OR
TWO
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
CONSERVE
THE
BEST
PEOPLE
IS
TO
PROMOTE
THEM
QUICKLY
THAT
MEANS
NEAR
BEGINNERS
BEING
PROMOTED
INTO
FIRST
LEVEL
MANAGEMENT
POSI
TIONS
THEY
MAY
HAVE
ONLY
FIVE
YEARS
OF
EXPERIENCE
AND
PERHAPS
LESS
THAN
TWO
YEARS
WITH
THE
COMPANY
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
VERY
DISCONCERTING
ABOUT
THESE
NUMBERS
A
PERSON
WITH
A
WORK
LIFE
OF
SAY
FORTY
YEARS
WILL
SPEND
FIVE
YEARS
WORKING
AND
THIRTY
FIVE
MANAGING
THAT
IMPLIES
AN
EXCEEDINGLY
TALL
NARROW
HIERARCHY
FIFTEEN
PERCENT
OF
THE
STAFF
IS
DOING
WORK
WITH
EIGHTY
FIVE
PERCENT
MANAGING
AS
LITTLE
AS
TEN
PERCENT
OF
THE
COST
COULD
BE
SPENT
ON
THE
WORKERS
WITH
NINETY
PERCENT
GOING
TO
REWARD
THE
MANAGERS
EVEN
MARX
DIDN
T
FORESEE
SUCH
TOP
HEAVINESS
OF
CAP
ITALISTIC
STRUCTURES
NOT
ONLY
IS
THE
STRUCTURE
WASTEFULLY
TOP
HEAVY
IT
TENDS
TO
HAVE
VERY
LIGHTWEIGHT
PEOPLE
AT
THE
BOTTOM
THIS
IS
SOMEWHAT
TRUE
THROUGHOUT
THE
INDUSTRY
BUT
STRIKINGLY
TRUE
IN
HIGH
TURNOVER
COM
PANIES
IT
NOT
UNUSUAL
TO
SEE
SERIOUS
MATURE
COMPANIES
TURNING
OUT
PRODUCTS
THAT
ARE
DEVELOPED
BY
WORKERS
WITH
AN
AVERAGE
AGE
IN
THEIR
TWENTIES
AND
AVERAGE
EXPERIENCE
OF
LESS
THAN
TWO
YEARS
PEOPLEWARE
MANY
OF
US
HAVE
COME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
COMPANIES
THAT
PROMOTE
EARLY
ARE
WHERE
THE
ACTION
IS
THAT
NATURAL
BECAUSE
AS
YOUNG
WORKERS
WE
RE
EAGER
TO
GET
AHEAD
BUT
FROM
THE
CORPORATE
PERSPEC
TIVE
LATE
PROMOTION
IS
A
SIGN
OF
HEALTH
IN
COMPANIES
WITH
LOW
TURNOVER
PROMOTION
INTO
THE
FIRST
LEVEL
MANAGEMENT
POSITION
COMES
ONLY
AFTER
AS
MUCH
AS
TEN
YEARS
WITH
THE
COMPANY
THIS
HAS
LONG
BEEN
TRUE
OF
SOME
OF
THE
STRONGEST
ORGANIZATIONS
WITHIN
IBM
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
PEOPLE
AT
THE
LOWEST
LEVEL
HAVE
ON
THE
AVERAGE
AT
LEAST
FIVE
YEARS
EXPERIENCE
THE
HIERARCHY
IS
LOW
AND
FLAT
WHY
PEOPLE
LEAVE
FOR
THE
INDIVIDUALS
CONSIDERING
A
CHANGE
IN
JOB
THE
REASONS
CAN
BE
AS
MANY
AND
VARIED
AS
THE
PERSONALITIES
INVOLVED
FOR
THE
ORGAN
IZATION
WITH
PATHOLOGICALLY
HIGH
TURNOVER
ANYTHING
OVER
FIFTY
PER
CENT
A
FEW
REASONS
ACCOUNT
FOR
MOST
DEPARTURES
AJUST
PASSING
THROUGH
MENTALITY
CO
WORKERS
ENGENDER
NO
FEELINGS
OF
LONG
TERM
INVOLVEMENT
IN
THE
JOB
A
FEELING
OF
DISPOSABILITY
MANAGEMENT
CAN
ONLY
THINK
OF
ITS
WORKERS
AS
INTERCHANGEABLE
PARTS
SINCE
TURNOVER
IS
SO
HIGH
NOBODY
IS
INDISPENSABLE
A
SENSE
THAT
LOYALTY
WOULD
BE
LUDICROUS
WHO
COULD
BE
LOYAL
TO
AN
ORGANIZATION
THAT
VIEWS
ITS
PEOPLE
AS
PARTS
THE
INSIDIOUS
EFFECT
HERE
IS
THAT
TURNOVER
ENGENDERS
TURNOVER
PEOPLE
LEAVE
QUICKLY
SO
THERE
NO
USE
SPENDING
MONEY
ON
TRAINING
SINCE
THE
COMPANY
HAS
INVESTED
NOTHING
IN
THE
INDIVIDUAL
THE
INDI
VIDUAL
THINKS
NOTHING
OF
MOVING
ON
NEW
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
HIRED
FOR
THEIR
EXTRAORDINARY
QUALITIES
SINCE
REPLACING
EXTRAORDINARY
QUALITIES
IS
TOO
DIFFICULT
THE
FEELING
THAT
THE
COMPANY
SEES
NOTHING
EXTRAOR
DINARY
IN
THE
WORKER
MAKES
THE
WORKER
FEEL
UNAPPRECIATED
AS
AN
IN
DIVIDUAL
OTHER
PEOPLE
ARE
LEAVING
ALL
THE
TIME
SO
THERE
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
YOU
IF
YOU
RE
STILL
HERE
NEXT
YEAR
A
SPECIAL
PATHOLOGY
THE
COMPANY
MOVE
THERE
IS
NO
BIGGER
EGO
TRIP
FOR
INSECURE
MANAGERS
THAN
MOVING
THE
COMPANY
TO
SOME
DISTANT
PLACE
THAT
IS
WHEELING
AND
DEALING
AT
ITS
BEST
INJECTING
SO
MUCH
MISERY
INTO
WORKERS
LIVES
MAKES
THE
MAN
HAPPY
TO
BE
HERE
AGERS
FEEL
POSITIVELY
GOD
LIKE
THE
NORMAL
BUSINESS
OF
RUNNING
THE
COMPANY
LETS
THEM
CONTROL
THEIR
PEOPLE
WORK
LIVES
BUT
THE
MOVE
LETS
THEM
HAVE
A
MEASURE
OF
CONTROL
OVER
EVEN
THEIR
PERSONAL
LIVES
OF
COURSE
THEY
ARE
MARVELOUSLY
SOMBER
WHEN
EXPLAINING
THE
RATIONALE
BEHIND
THE
MOVE
THEY
TALK
ABOUT
THE
ESCALATING
PRICE
OF
SPACE
OR
THE
TAX
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
OLD
LOCATION
AND
THE
BENEFITS
OF
THE
NEW
ONE
WHATEVER
THE
REASONS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
MOVE
YOU
CAN
BE
SURE
THE
REAL
REASONS
ARE
VERY
DIFFERENT
THE
REAL
REASON
FOR
THE
MOVE
IS
A
POLITICAL
DEAL
OR
A
CHANCE
TO
BUILD
A
NEW
EDIFICE
FINALLY
A
PIECE
OF
PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
THEIR
IMPORTANCE
OR
REDUCTION
OF
THE
BOSS
COMMUTE
BY
MOVING
THE
COMPANY
TO
THE
SUBURB
WHERE
THE
BOSS
HAPPENS
TO
LIVE
SOMETIMES
IT
SIMPLY
THE
NAKED
EXERCISE
OF
POWER
THE
MORE
EGOCENTRIC
THE
MANAGER
THE
MORE
INTENSE
THE
FOND
NESS
FOR
THE
COMPANY
MOVE
LISTEN
TO
ROBERT
TOWNSEND
IN
UP
THE
ORGANIZATION
ON
THE
SUBJECT
IF
YOU
VE
INHERITED
OR
BUILT
AN
OFFICE
THAT
NEEDS
A
REAL
HOUSE
CLEANING
THE
ONLY
SURE
CURE
IS
MOVE
THE
WHOLE
THING
OUT
OF
TOWN
LEAVING
THE
DEAD
WOOD
BEHIND
ONE
OF
MY
FRIENDS
HAS
DONE
IT
FOUR
TIMES
WITH
DIFFERENT
COM
PANIES
THE
RESULTS
ARE
ALWAYS
THE
SAME
THE
GOOD
ONES
ARE
CONFIDENT
OF
THEIR
FUTURES
AND
GO
WITH
YOU
THE
PEOPLE
WITH
DUBIOUS
FUTURES
AND
THEIR
WIVES
DON
T
HAVE
TO
FACE
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
VE
BEEN
FIRED
THE
COMPANY
LEFT
TOWN
THEY
SAY
THEY
GET
JOB
OFFERS
QUICKLY
USUALLY
FROM
YOUR
COMPETITORS
WHO
THINK
THEY
RE
CONDUCTING
A
RAID
THE
NEW
PEOPLE
AT
DES
TINY
CITY
ARE
BETTER
THAN
THE
ONES
YOU
LEFT
BEHIND
AND
THEY
RE
INFUSED
WITH
ENTHUSIASM
BECAUSE
THEY
VE
BEEN
EXPOSED
ONLY
TO
YOUR
BEST
PEOPLE
UP
THE
ORGANIZATION
WHAT
THIS
IS
TO
USE
A
TECHNICAL
TERM
IS
THE
PUREST
CRAP
ONE
THING
TOWNSEND
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
MISSED
ENTIRELY
IS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
WOMEN
IN
THE
WORKFORCE
THE
TYPICAL
PERSON
BEING
MOVED
TODAY
IS
PART
OF
A
TWO
CAREER
FAMILY
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
THAT
EQUATION
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
BEING
MOVED
SO
THE
CORPORATE
MOVE
COMES
DOWN
HARD
ON
THE
COUPLE
RELATIONSHIP
AT
A
VERY
DELICATE
POINT
IT
BRINGS
INTOL
ERABLE
STRESS
TO
BEAR
ON
THE
ACCOMMODATION
THEY
RE
BOTH
STRIVING
TO
PEOPLEWARE
ACHIEVE
TO
ALLOW
TWO
FULL
FLEDGED
CAREERS
THAT
HITTING
BELOW
THE
BELT
MODERN
COUPLES
WON
T
PUT
UP
WITH
IT
AND
THEY
WON
T
FOR
GIVE
IT
THE
COMPANY
MOVE
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
POSSIBLE
IN
THE
AND
TODAY
IT
IS
FOLLY
EVEN
IN
THE
SIXTIES
ORGANIZATIONAL
MOVES
DIDN
T
MAKE
MUCH
SENSE
A
CASE
IN
POINT
IS
THE
DECISION
BY
AT
T
BELL
LABORA
TORIES
TO
MOVE
THE
SIX
HUNDRED
PERSON
PROJECT
FROM
NEW
JERSEY
TO
ILLINOIS
IN
THERE
WERE
MANY
REASONS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
MOVE
BUT
IT
NOW
SEEMS
LIKELY
THAT
THERE
WERE
SOME
POLITICAL
SHENANIGANS
INVOLVED
IN
THE
THEN
SENATORS
KENNEDY
AND
JOHNSON
HAD
ARRANGED
FOR
HUGE
NEW
INVESTMENTS
IN
MASSACHUSETTS
AND
TEXAS
AND
SENATOR
DIRKSEN
OF
ILLINOIS
HAD
SOMETHING
COMING
WHAT
A
COUP
FOR
DIRKSEN
IF
SIX
HUNDRED
HIGH
SALARY
LOW
POLLUTION
JOBS
COULD
BE
MOVED
INTO
HIS
STATE
A
LITTLE
PRESSURE
ON
AT
T
PERHAPS
TO
TRADE
OFF
THE
MOVE
AGAINST
CONCESSIONS
IN
SOME
ANTITRUST
MATTER
OR
REGULATORY
RELIEF
THE
RATIONALE
WITHIN
THE
LABS
WAS
THAT
THE
COST
WOULDN
T
BE
TOO
EXCESSIVE
A
FEW
THOUSAND
DOL
LARS
PER
PERSON
IN
RELOCATION
EXPENSES
AND
MAYBE
A
BIT
OF
TURNOVER
YEARS
AFTER
THE
ESS
CUTOVER
I
ARRANGED
TO
INTERVIEW
RAY
KETCHLEDGE
WHO
HAD
RUN
THE
PROJECT
I
WAS
WRITING
SOME
ESSAYS
ON
MANAGEMENT
OF
LARGE
EFFORTS
AND
ESS
CERTAINLY
QUALIFIED
I
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
HE
SAW
AS
HIS
MAIN
SUCCESSES
AND
FAILURES
AS
BOSS
FORGET
THE
SUC
CESSES
HE
SAID
THE
FAILURE
WAS
THAT
MOVE
YOU
CAN
T
BELIEVE
WHAT
IT
COST
US
IN
TURNOVER
HE
WENT
ON
TO
GIVE
SOME
FIGURES
THE
IMMEDIATELY
CALCULABLE
COST
OF
THE
MOVE
WAS
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
QUIT
BEFORE
RELOCATION
DAY
EXPRESSED
AS
A
PERCENTAGE
OF
THOSE
MOVED
THIS
INITIAL
TURNOVER
WAS
GREATER
THAN
THE
FRENCH
LOSSES
IN
THE
TRENCHES
OF
WORLD
WAR
I
TDM
YOU
CAN
DO
LESS
DAMAGE
TO
YOUR
ORGANIZATION
BY
LINING
UP
THE
STAFF
IN
FRONT
OF
A
MACHINE
GUN
THAN
YOU
DO
BY
MOVING
AND
THAT
ACCOUNTS
ONLY
FOR
THE
INITIAL
LOSS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
BELL
LABS
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
LARGE
EXODUS
STARTING
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AFTER
THE
MOVE
THESE
WERE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
HONESTLY
TRIED
TO
GO
ALONG
WITH
THE
COMPANY
THEY
MOVED
AND
WHEN
THEY
DIDN
T
LIKE
THE
NEW
LOCATION
THEY
MOVED
AGAIN
HAPPY
TO
BE
HERE
THE
MENTALITY
OF
PERMANENCE
OVER
THE
YEARS
WE
HAVE
BEEN
PRIVILEGED
TO
WORK
AND
CONSULT
FOR
A
FEW
COMPANIES
WITH
EXTRAORDINARILY
LOW
TURNOVER
YOU
WON
T
BE
SURPRISED
TO
LEARN
THAT
LOW
TURNOVER
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
GOOD
THING
ABOUT
THESE
COMPANIES
INDEED
THEY
SEEM
TO
EXCEL
AT
MANY
OR
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
CONSCIOUS
QUALITIES
DISCUSSED
IN
THESE
PAGES
THEY
ARE
THE
BEST
THE
BEST
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
NOT
OF
A
KIND
THEY
ARE
MORE
NOTABLE
FOR
THEIR
DISSIMILARITIES
THAN
FOR
THEIR
LIKENESSES
BUT
ONE
THING
THAT
THEY
ALL
SHARE
IS
A
PREOCCUPATION
WITH
BEING
THE
BEST
IT
IS
A
CONSTANT
TOPIC
IN
THE
CORRIDORS
IN
WORKING
MEETINGS
AND
IN
BULL
SESSIONS
THE
CONVERSE
OF
THIS
EFFECT
IS
EQUALLY
TRUE
IN
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
ARE
NOT
THE
BEST
THE
TOPIC
IS
RARELY
OR
NEVER
DISCUSSED
THE
BEST
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
CONSCIOUSLY
STRIVING
TO
BE
BEST
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
GOAL
THAT
PROVIDES
COMMON
DIRECTION
JOINT
SATIS
FACTION
AND
A
STRONG
BINDING
EFFECT
THERE
IS
A
MENTALITY
OF
PERMA
NENCE
ABOUT
SUCH
PLACES
THE
SENSE
THAT
YOU
D
BE
DUMB
TO
LOOK
FOR
A
JOB
ELSEWHERE
PEOPLE
WOULD
LOOK
AT
YOU
AS
THOUGH
YOU
WERE
DAFT
THIS
IS
THE
KIND
OF
COMMUNITY
FEELING
THAT
CHARACTERIZED
JHE
AMERICAN
SMALL
TOWNS
OF
THE
PAST
IT
IS
SOMETHING
TOO
OFTEN
MISS
ING
FROM
THE
CITIES
AND
MUNICIPALITIES
WHERE
WE
LIVE
SO
IT
IS
ALL
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
IN
THE
WORKPLACE
SOME
AMBITIOUS
COMPANIES
SET
OUT
EXPLICITLY
TO
ENGENDER
A
SENSE
OF
COMMUNITY
AT
READER
DIGEST
AND
CERTAIN
HEWLETT
PACKARD
LOCATIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
COMPANY
HAS
SET
UP
COMMUNITY
GARDENS
FOR
EMPLOYEES
AT
LUNCH
HOUR
THE
FIELDS
ARE
FULL
OF
AMATEUR
HOERS
AND
WEEDERS
AND
PEOPLE
TALKING
TOMATOES
OVER
THEIR
FENCES
THERE
ARE
CONTESTS
TO
GROW
THE
SWEETEST
PEA
OR
THE
LONGEST
ZUCCHINI
AND
ACTIVE
BARTERING
SESSIONS
WHERE
YOU
CAN
TRADE
AWAY
SOME
OF
YOUR
GARLIC
FOR
CORN
YOU
CAN
PROVE
THAT
COMMUNITY
GARDENS
DON
T
MAKE
ANY
SENSE
AT
ALL
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
WHATEVER
COSTS
THERE
ARE
WILL
COME
RIGHT
OUT
OF
THIS
QUARTER
BOTTOM
LINE
AT
MOST
COMPANIES
THAT
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
QUASH
THE
CONCEPT
IMMEDIATELY
BUT
IN
THE
BEST
ORGANIZA
TIONS
THE
SHORT
TERM
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
MATTERS
WHAT
MATTERS
MORE
IS
BEING
BEST
AND
THAT
A
LONG
TERM
CONCEPT
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
STAY
AT
SUCH
COMPANIES
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
WIDESPREAD
SENSE
THAT
YOU
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
STAY
THE
COMPANY
INVESTS
HUGELY
IN
YOUR
PERSONAL
GROWTH
THERE
MAY
BE
A
MASTER
PROGRAM
OR
AN
EXTENSIVE
TRAINING
PERIOD
FOR
NEW
HIRES
AS
MUCH
AS
A
PEOPLEWARE
YEAR
IN
SOME
PLACES
IT
HARD
TO
MISS
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
YOU
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
STAY
WHEN
THE
COMPANY
HAS
JUST
INVESTED
THAT
MUCH
IN
YOUR
FORMATION
A
COMMON
FEATURE
OF
COMPANIES
WITH
THE
LOWEST

IS
WIDESPREAD

TO
MAKE
A

THE
COMPANY
PROVIDED
THOSE

NO

IS
A
DEAD
END
AGAIN
ONE
CAN
PROVE
THAT
RETRAINING
IS
NOT
THE
CHEAPEST
WAY
TO
FILL
A
NEW
SLOT
IT
ALWAYS
CHEAPER
IN
THE
SHORT
RUN
TO
FIRE
THE
PERSON
WHO
NEEDS

AND

SOMEONE

WHO
ALREADY
HAS
THE
REQUIRED

MOST

JUST
THAT

THAT

AN

BUT
IT
EASY
ENOUGH
TO
SEE
WHAT
WILL
MAKE
IT
ALL
COME
OUT
RIGHT
LET
SEE
WE
CAN
JUST
DROP
THIS
WHOLE
FILE
INTO
THE

AND
PRETEND
IT
NEVER

THEN
WE
VOID

AND

BEFORE

A

HAS
JUST
HEALED

SOMETHING
HAD

LEFT
OUT
OF
ITS
ORIGINAL

SOMETHING
THAT
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
NECESSARY
THE

WHO
MAKE
THE

GO
HAVE
FIXED
IT
ON
THE
FLY
IT
HAPPENS
ALL
THE
TIME
DETERMINISTIC
AND
NON
DETERMINISTIC
WHEN
YOU
AUTOMATE
A
PREVIOUSLY
ALL
HUMAN
SYSTEM
IT
BECOMES
ENTIRELY
DETERMINISTIC
THE
NEW
SYSTEM
IS
CAPABLE
OF
MAKING
ONLY
THOSE
RESPONSES
PLANNED
EXPLICITLY
BY
ITS
BUILDERS
SO
THE
SELF
HEAL
ING
QUALITY
IS
LOST
ANY
RESPONSE
THAT
WILL
BE
REQUIRED
MUST
BE
PUT
THERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IF
EVER
THE
SYSTEM
NEEDS
TO
BE
HEALED
THAT
CAN
ONLY
BE
DONE
OUTSIDE
THE
CONTEXT
OF

AND
RECONSTRUCT
IT
WITH

PEOPLEWARE
IN
ONE
VIEW
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
RATHER
MESSY
AND
UNCONTROLLABLE
SELF
HEALING
CAPACITY
IS
A
POSITIVE
BENEFIT
OF
AUTOMATION
THE
SYSTEM
IS
PLANNED
RIGHT
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
THEN
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
TIN
KERING
DURING
OPERATION
BUT
IT
NO
SECRET
THAT
THIS
CAN
BE
EXPEN
SIVE
AUTOMATORS
SPEND
MUCH
OF
THEIR

THINKING
THROUGH
SITUA
TIONS
THAT
ARE
SO
UNLIKELY
OR
OCCUR
SO
RARELY
THAT
THE
HUMAN
ELEMENTS
OF
THE
OLD
SYSTEM
NEVER
EVEN
BOTHERED
TO
CONSIDER
THEM
UNLESS
AND
UNTIL
THEY
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
IF
THE
BUSINESS
POLICY
GOVERNING
THE
NEW
SYSTEM
HAS
A
SUFFICIENT
DEGREE
OF
NATURAL
AD
HOC
RACY
IT
A
MISTAKE
TO
AUTOMATE
IT
DETERMINISM
WILL
BE
NO
ASSET
THEN
THE
SYS
TEM
WILL
BE
IN
CONSTANT
NEED
OF
MAINTENANCE
THE
REASON
THAT
NON
DETERMINISTIC
SYSTEMS
CAN
OFTEN
HEAL
THEMSELVES
PAINLESSLY
AND
ELEGANTLY
SOMETIMES
AT
NO
COST
AT
ALL
IS
THAT
THE
HUMANS
WHO
MAKE
UP
THE
SYSTEM
HAVE
AN
EASY
FAMILIARITY
WITH
THE
UNDERLYING
GOALS
WHEN
A
NEW
SITUATION
CROPS
UP
THEY
KNOW
IMMEDIATELY
WHAT
ACTION
MAKES
SENSE
SOMEDAY
IT
MAY
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
TEACH
COMPUTERS
THE
GOALS
OF
THE
SYSTEM
INSTEAD
OF
THE
ACTIONS
EXPECTED
TO
ACHIEVE
THE
GOALS
BUT
RIGHT
NOW
THAT
BEYOND
THE
HORIZON
THE
POINT
HERE
IS
THAT
MAKING
A
SYSTEM
DETERMINISTIC
WILL
RESULT
IN
THE
LOSS
OF
ITS
ABILITY
TO
HEAL
ITSELF
THE
ORGANIZATION
THAT
YOU
WORK
IN
OR
MANAGE
IS
IN
SOME
SENSE
A
SYSTEM
IT
IS
AN
AMALGAM
OF
INTERACTING
PEOPLE
AND
PROCESSES
THAT
EXIST
TO
ACHIEVE
SOME
END
IT
ALL
THE
VOGUE
THESE
DAYS
TO
TALK
OF
MAKING
SUCH
SYSTEMS
MORE
DETERMINISTIC
THAT
BRINGS
US
TO
THE
SUB
JECT
OF
METHODOLOGY
THE
COVERT
MEANING
OF
METHODOLOGY
THE
MADDENING
THING
ABOUT
MOST
OF
OUR
ORGANIZATIONS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONLY
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
STAFF
THEM
WOULDN
T
IT
BE
NICE
IF
WE
COULD
GET
AROUND
THAT
NATURAL
LIMIT
AND
HAVE
GOOD
ORGANIZATIONS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
STAFFED
BY
MEDIOCRE
OR
INCOMPETENT
PEOPLE
NOTHING
COULD
BE
EASIER
ALL
WE
NEED
IS
TRUMPET
FANFARE
PLEASE
A
METHODOLOGY
A
METHODOLOGY
IS
A
GENERAL
SYSTEMS
THEORY
OF
HOW
A
WHOLE
CLASS
OF
THOUGHT
INTENSIVE
WORK
OUGHT
TO
BE
CONDUCTED
IT
COMES
IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
FAT
BOOK
THAT
SPECIFIES
IN
DETAIL
EXACTLY
WHAT
STEPS
TO
TAKE
AT
ANY
TIME
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
DOING
THE
WORK
REGARDLESS
OF
WHERE
OR
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WRITE
THE
METHODOLOGY
ARE
SMART
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CARRY
IT
OUT
CAN
BE
DUMB
THEY
NEVER
HAVE
TO
TURN
THE
SELF
HEALING
SYSTEM
THEIR
BRAINS
TO
THE
ON
POSITION
ALL
THEY
DO
IS
START
ON
PAGE
ONE
AND
FOLLOW
THE
YELLOW
BRICK
ROAD
LIKE
HAPPY
LITTLE
MUNCHKINS
ALL
THE
WAY
FROM
THE
START
OF
THE
JOB
TO
ITS
SUCCESSFUL
COMPLETION
THE
METHODOLOGY
MAKES
ALL
THE
DECISIONS
THE
PEOPLE
MAKE
NONE
THE
ORGANIZATION
BECOMES
ENTIRELY
DETERMINISTIC
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
SYSTEM
A
TEAM
OF
HUMAN
WORKERS
WILL
LOSE
ITS
SELF
HEALING
PROPERTIES
TO
THE
EXTENT
IT
BECOMES
DETERMINISTIC
THE
RESULT
CAN
BE
WORKERS
PROCEEDING
IN
DIRECTIONS
THAT
MAKE
NO
SENSE
TO
THEM
AT
ALL
A
SURE
SIGN
THAT
THEY
CAN
T
BE
DOING
ANY
GOOD
SOME
YEARS
AGO
WE
CONDUCTED
A
POST
MORTEM
OF
A
FAILED
PROJECT
BY
ASKING
EACH
OF
THE
PROJECT
WORKERS
TO
SPEAK
FOR
AN
HOUR
OR
SO
INTO
A
TAPE
RECORDER
THEY
DID
THIS
IN
THE
PRIVACY
OF
THEIR
OWN
HOMES
AND
WE
ASSURED
THEM
THAT
ONLY
WE
TWO
THE
CONSULTANTS
WOULD
EVER
HEAR
THE
TAPES
ONE
OF
THE
SPEAKERS
GAVE
US
THIS
OBSERVATION
BY

WE
HAD
BEEN
DOING
THIS
APPLYING
ONE
OF
THE
TECHNIQUES
DICTATED
FROM
ON
HIGH
FOR
NEARLY
TWO
MONTHS
I
COULDN
T
SEE
HOW
IT
WAS
HELPING
US
IN
ANY
WAY
BUT
GEORGE
KEPT
ASSURING
US
THAT
IT
WAS
HE
SAID
WE
SHOULD
TRUST
IN
THE

AND
IT
WOULD
ALL
WORK
OUT
IN
THE

F
OF

IT
DIDN

THE

WORKERS
ARE
THE
ONES
MOST
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
TERRITORY
OF
THE

IF
A
GIVEN
DIRECTION
DOESN
T
MAKE

TO

IT
DOESRI
TMAKE

AT

THERE
IS
A
BIG

BETWEEN

M
METHODOLOGY
IS
A
BASIC
APPROACH
ONE
TAKES
TO
GETTING
A
JOB
DONE
IT
DOESN
T
RESIDE
IN
A
FAT
BOOK
BUT
RATHER
INSIDE
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
CARRYING
OUT
THE
WORK
SUCH
A
METHODOLOGY
CONSISTS
OF
TWO
PARTS
A
TAILORED
PLAN
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
WORK
AT
HAND
AND
A
BODY
OF
SKILLS
NECESSARY
TO
EFFECT
THE

ONE
COULD
HARDLY
BE
OPPOSED
TO

THE
WORK
COULDN
T
EVEN
BEGIN
WITHOUT
IT
BUT
A
METHODOLOGY
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
BIG
M
METHODOLOGY
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
CENTRALIZE
THINKING
ALL
MEANINGFUL
DECISIONS
ARE
MADE
BY
THE
METHODOLOGY
BUILDERS
NOT
BY
THE
STAFF
ASSIGNED
TO

THE

THOSE
WHO
ESPOUSE
A

HAVE
A
LONG
LIST
OF

INCLUDING
STANDARDIZA
TION
DOCUMENTARY
UNIFORMITY
MANAGERIAL
CONTROL
AND
STATE
OF
THE

TECHNIQUES
THESE
MAKE
UP
THE
OVERT
CASE
FOR

THE
COVERT

IS
SIMPLER
AND
CRUDER

THAT

OF

IF

THROUGH

THE

WILL
FAIL
NO
METHODOLOGY
WILL
HELP
WORSE
STILL
METHODOLOGIES
CAN
DO
GRIEVOUS
DAMAGE
TO
EFFORTS
IN
WHICH
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
FULLY
COMPETENT
THEY
DO
THIS
BY
TRYING
TO
FORCE
THE
WORK
INTO
A
FIXED
MOLD
THAT
GUARANTEES
A
MORASS
OF
PAPERWORK
A
PAUCITY
OF
METHODS
AN
ABSENCE
OF
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
A
GENERAL
LOSS
OF
MOTIVATION
THE
FOLLOWING
PARAGRAPHS
COMMENT
ON
EACH
OF
THESE
EFFECTS
PAPERWORK
THE
METHODOLOGIES
THEMSELVES
ARE
HUGE
AND
GET
TING
HUGER
THEY
HAVE
TO
GROW
TO
ADD
THE
FEATURES
REQUIRED
BY
EACH
NEW
KIND
OF
SITUATION
IT
NOT
AT
ALL
UNUSUAL
FOR
A
METHODOLOGY
TO
USE
UP
A
LINEAR
FOOT
OR
MORE
OF
SHELF
SPACE
WORSE
THEY
ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE
TO
BUILD
DOCUMENTS
RATHER
THAN
DO
WORK
THE
DOCUMENTARY
OBSESSION
OF
SUCH
METHODOLOGIES
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
RESULTED
FROM
PARA
NOID
DEFENSIVE
THINKING
ALONG
THESE
LINES
THE
LAST
PROJECT
GENERAT
ED
A
TON
OF
PAPER
AND
IT
WAS
STILL
A
DISASTER
SO
THIS
PROJECT
WILL
HAVE
TO
GENERATE
TWO
TONS
THE
TECHNOLOGICAL
SECTORS
OF
OUR
ECONOMY
HAVE
NOW
BEEN
THROUGH
A
DECADE
LONG
FLIRTATION
WITH
THE
IDEA
THAT
MORE
AND
MORE
AND
MORE
PAPERWORK
WILL
SOLVE
ITS
PROBLEMS
PER
HAPS
IT
TIME
TO
INTRODUCE
THIS
CONTRARY
AND
HERETICAL
NOTION
VOLUMINOUS
DOCUMENTATION
IS
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
NOT
PART
OF
THE
SOLUTION
METHODS
THE
CENTERPIECE
OF
MOST
METHODOLOGIES
IS
THE
CON
CEPT
OF
STANDARDIZED
METHODS
IF
THERE
WERE
A
THOUSAND
DIFFERENT
BUT
EQUALLY
GOOD
WAYS
TO
GO
ABOUT
THE
WORK
IT
MIGHT
MAKE
SOME
SENSE
TO
CHOOSE
ONE
AND
STANDARDIZE
UPON
IT
BUT
IN
OUR
STATE
OF
TECHNO
LOGICAL
INFANCY
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
COMPETING
METHODS
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
WORK
WE
DO
WHEN
THERE
ARE
GENUINE
ALTERNATIVES
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
AND
MASTER
THEM
ALL
TO
STANDARDIZE
ON
ONE
IS
TO
EXCLUDE
THE
OTHERS
IT
BOILS
DOWN
TO
THE
VIEW
THAT
KNOWLEDGE
IS
SO
VALUABLE
WE
MUST
USE
IT
SPARINGLY
THE
SELF
HEALING
RESPONSIBILITY
IF
SOMETHING
GOES
WRONG
ON
A
METHODOLOGY
EFFORT
THE
FAULT
IS
WITH
THE
METHODOLOGY
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
THE
METHODOLOGY
AFTER
ALL
MADE
ALL
OF
THE
DECISIONS
WORKING
IN
SUCH
AN
ENVIRONMENT
IS
VIRTUALLY
RESPONSIBILITY
FREE
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY
BUT
THEY
WON
T
UNLESS
GIVEN
ACCEPTABLE
DEGREES
OF
FREEDOM
TO
CONTROL
THEIR
OWN
SUCCESS
MOTIVATION
THE
MESSAGE
IN
THE
DECISION
TO
IMPOSE
A
METH
ODOLOGY
IS
APPARENT
TO
ALL
NOTHING
COULD
BE
MORE
DEMOTIVATING
THAN
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
MANAGEMENT
THINKS
ITS
WORKERS
INCOMPE
TENT
THE
ISSUE
OF
MALICIOUS
COMPLIANCE
THOSE
WHO
BUILD
METHODOLOGIES
ARE
TORTURED
BY
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
THINKING
PEOPLE
WILL
SIMPLY
IGNORE
THEM
IN
MANY
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
IS
JUST
WHAT
HAPPENS
EVEN
MORE
UPSETTING
IS
THE
OPPOSITE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
PEOPLE
WON
T
IGNORE
THE
METHODOLOGY
BUT
WILL
INSTEAD
DO
EXACTLY
WHAT
IT
SAYS
TO
DO
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
KNOW
DOING
SO
WILL
LEAD
TO
WASTED
TIME
UNWORKABLE
PRODUCTS
AND
MEANINGLESS
DOCUMENTATION
THIS
IS
WHAT
OUR
COHORT

CALLS
MALICIOUS

IS
POSSIBLE
WHEN
THE

SAYS
YOU

EVEN

WITHOUT

COMING

DURING

THE

IT

BUREAUCRATIC
BUT
IF
YOU

THE

CAREFULLY
YOU
WILL

THAT
THE

SEVERAL

ITS
PRIMARY
BENEFIT
IS
THAT

WHAT

IT
PROTECTS
THE

FROM

SARY

BY
ENSURING
THAT

SYSTEMATI
CALLY
THE
ADDITION
OF

TRADITIONALLY
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
SERIOUS

BECAUSE
OF
THE
RELATED

IN

IMPROVES
THE
QUALITY
OF

MADE
ABOUT

BY
ENSURING
THAT

SIMILARLY
IT
IMPROVES
THE

BY
ENSURING
THAT

ONE
OF
THE
MORE
SUBTLE
RISKS
ON
A

IS
THAT

THE

CONTINUOUSLY

BY

IN
THE

THE

SHOULD
COLLECT
PROPOSED

THE

ARE
IDEAL
FOR
CONSIDERING

OF

HOW
OFTEN

THEY

THE

KEEP

THE
POINT
OF
THIS

IS
TO
PRESENT
MANY
ALTERNATIVES
TO
THE
USER
BEFORE
YOU
COMMIT
MUCH
EFFORT
TO
ANY
PARTICULAR
APPROACH
THE

TEAM
SHOULD
DEVELOP
JUST
ENOUGH
TO

THE

RE
GOING

IF
THE

IS

IN
AN

THAT

MINIMIZES

OF

NOT

THEY
WANT
UNTIL
THEY
SEE
IT

THEN
CHANGING

LATER
IN

THIS
KIND
OF

REDUCES
THE

WHICH
IS
TRADITIONALLY
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
SERIOUS
RISKS
A

SOME
OF
THE

AS
SOCIATED
WITH

ON

SIDE
THEY
ELIMINATE
THE

OF

OF

STORYBOARDS
ELIMINATE
THE
PROBLEM
OF

THINKING
THAT
A

ALMOST
THE

THE
ONE
DISADVANTAGE
OF

THAT

SIMPLY
CANNOT

FROM

THIS
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
DISADVANTAGE

REASON

THE

THAT

THEY

THAT

FINALLY

WHAT

MY
STRONG
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT

BE

HOWEVER
THAT
DEVELOPERS

WORKED
ON

WITH

TURES
SOMETIMES
RESIST
THE
RESTRICTIONS
THE

PLACES
ON
THEIR
CODING
ONCE
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
THE
GOAL
OF
ARCHITECTURE
IS
TO
REDUCE
COMPLEXITY
IT
BECOMES
CLEAR
THAT
THE
ARCHITECT
MUST
FOCUS
AS
MUCH
ON
WHAT
TO
LEAVE
OUT
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
AS
ON
WHAT
TO
PUT
IN
NOTATION
FOR
LARGE
PROJECTS
THE

SHOULD
ADOPT
A
STANDARD
NOTATION
SUCH
AS
THE
BOOCH

UNIFIED

UML
NOTATION
FOR

JUST
BE

THAT

UNDERSTANDS
WHAT
THE

MEAN
AND
THAT
THE
DIAGRAMS
ARE
READILY
AVAILABLE
IN
A
PUBLIC
LOCATION
LATER
IN
THE

AT
DETAILED

TIME
THE
DEVELOPMENT
TEAM
MAY
USE
THE
SAME
NOTATION
IT
USED
FOR
THE
ARCHITECTURE
OR
ONE
THAT
APPROPRIATE
FOR
MORE
DETAILED
DESIGN
WORK
IF
IT
USES
UML
FOR
THE
ARCHITECTURE
IT
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CONTINUE
USING
IT
THE
DEVELOPMENT
TEAM
MIGHT
ALSO
BEGIN
USING
PSEUDOCODE
TO
EXPRESS
THE
DESIGNS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
ROUTINES
REGARDLESS
OFWHAT
IT
CHOOSES
THE
DEVELOPMENT
TEAM
SHOULD
AGREE
UPON
THE
SPECIFIC
NOTATION
AT
ARCHITECTURE
TIME
SO
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
USED
PROJECTWIDE
CHANGE
SCENARIOS
AND
CHANGE
STRATEGY
ONE
KEY
FEATURE
OF
A
SUCCESSFUL
ARCHITECTURE
IS
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
PROGRAM
AREAS
THAT
ARE
MOST
LIKELY
TO
CHANGE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
DAMAGING
INFLUENCES
ON
A
PROJECT
ARE
LATE
UNEXPECTED
CHANGES
TO
THE
SOFTWARE
CHANGES
THAT
OC
CUR
AFTER
THE
DESIGN
IS
COMPLETE
AND
WHILE
IMPLEMENTATION
IS
UNDER
WAY
PROJECTS
THAT
DEAL
POORLYWITH
SUCH
CHANGES
CAN
RUN
INTO
TROUBLE
EVENIFTHEY
ARE
UNDER
CONTROL
UP
TO
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
THE
CHANGES
ARE
INTRODUCED
SO
THE
ARCHITECTURE
SHOULD
LIST
THE
MOST
LIKELY
CHANGES
TO
THE
PROGRAM
AND
OUTLINE
HOXV
EACH
CHANGE
WILL
BE
ADDRESSED
ONE
COMMON
SOURCE
OF
CHANGES
IS
SHAKY
REQUIREMENTS
SO
THE
ARCHITECTURE
SHOULD
INCLUDE
A
LIST
OF
THE
REQUIREMENTS
THAT
ARE
THE
LEAST
STABLE
ANOTHER
COMMON
SOURCE
OF
PROBLEMS
IS
CHANGES
IN
SUPPORTING
TECH
NOLOGY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DEVELOPERS
FIND
THAT
THE
COMPANY
THAT
PROVIDED
THE
CLASS
LIBRARY
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
USING
HAS
GONE
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
BE
SURE
THE
PROJECT
ISN
T
BOUND
TO
ANY
SINGLE
SOURCE
TECHNOLOGY
COMPILER
VENDOR
HARD
WARE
PLATFORM
AND
SO
ON
WHERE
THAT
NOT
POSSIBLE
BE
SURE
THE
ARCHITEC
TURE
CONTAINS
FIREWALLS
SO
THAT
THE
DEVELOPERS
CAN
RECOVER
IF
THAT
SINGLE
SOURCE
TECHNOLOGY
BECOMES
UNRELIABLE
IN
CONSIDERING
CHANGE
SCENARIOS
STRIVE
TO
ELABORATE
ABOUT
PERCENT
OF
POSSIBLE
SCENARIOS
AND
THEN
STOP
THE
ARCHITECTURE
TEAM
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
ANTICIPATE
EVERY
POSSIBLE
CHANGE
AND
BY
THE
TIME
IT
HAS
ELABORATED
PER
CENT
OF
THE
SCENARIOS
IT
WILL
HAVE
REACHED
A
POINT
OF
DIMINISHING
RETURNS
REUSE
ANALYSIS
AND
BUY
VS
BUILD
DECISIONS
ONE
KEY
COMPONENT
OF
THE
ARCHITECTURE
IS
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
WHICH
COM
PONENTS
WILL
BE
PURCHASED
COMMERCIALLY
WHICH
WILL
BE
REUSED
FROM
INTERNAL
SOURCES
AND
WHICH
WILL
BE
CREATED
FROM
SCRATCH
THE
PROJECT
APPROACH
TO
REUSE
WILL
AFFECT
THE
REST
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
DESIGN
SO
IT
SHOULD
BE
DEFINED
AT
ARCHITECTURE
TIME
IF
THE
ARCHITECTURE
TEAM
DECIDES
TO
BASE
AN
APPLICATION
ON
A
COMMERCIAL
APPLICATION
FRAMEWORK
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
REST
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
WILL
NEED
TO
BE
DESIGNED
AROUND
THAT
FRAME
WORK
ANOTHER
REASON
THAT
REUSE
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
AT
ARCHITECTURE
TIME
IS
THAT
THE
APPROACH
TO
REUSE
HAS
A
DRAMATIC
COST
AND
SCHEDULE
IMPLICATIONS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
POWERFUL
WAYS
TO
SHORTEN
A
SOFTWARE
SCHEDULE
AND
REDUCE
COSTS
IS
TO
BUY
COMPONENTS
OR
REUSE
EXISTING
SOFTWARE
INSTEAD
OF
BUILDING
NEW
SOFTWARE
THE
ARCHITECTURE
TEAM
SHOULD
NOT
LIMIT
ITS
REUSE
CONSIDERATIONS
TO
SOURCE
CODE
IT
SHOULD
ALSO
CONSIDER
HOW
TO
REUSE
DATA
DETAILED
DESIGNS
TEST
CASES
PLANS
DOCUMENTATION
AND
EVEN
ARCHITECTURAL
COMPONENTS
ALL
OF
WHICH
CAN
SOMETIMES
BE
USED
AGAIN
APPROACHES
TO
STANDARD
FUNCTIONAL
AREAS
IN
ADDITION
TO
SYSTEM
ORGANIZATIONAL
ISSUES
THE
ARCHITECTURE
SHOULD
FOCUS
ON
THE
HANDFUL
OF

DECISIONS
THAT
HAVE
THE
MOST
SWEEPING

FOR
DETAILED

HERE
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST

THE

ESTIMATION
IS
A
DOUBLE
BARRELED
PROBLEM
THE
FIRSTPART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ESTIMATION
ITSELF
IS
TECHNICALLY
DIFFICULT
THE
GUIDELINES
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
PRECEDING
SECTION
OUTLINE
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
TO
OVERCOME
THOSE
DIFFICULTIES
THE
SECOND
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ESTIMATION
IS
MADE
EVEN
MORE
DIFFICULT
BY
PRESSURES
FROM
MARKETERS
MANAGERS
CUSTOMERS
AND
OTHER
PROJECT
STAKEHOLDERS
WHO
WANT
THE
ESTIMATES
TO
TURN
OUT
MORE
TO
THEIR
LIKING
IT
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
FOR
AN
ORGANIZATION
TO
USE
THE
MOST
ADVANCED
ESTIMATION
SOFTWARE
AVAILABLE
BASE
ITS
ESTIMATES
ON
THE
PAST
PERFORMANCE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WILL
BUILD
THE
NEW
SOFTWARE
AND
THEN
HAVE
AN
UNINFORMED
EXECUTIVE
CUT
THE
ESTIMATES
IN
HALF
BECAUSE
THE
SCHEDULE
IS
TOO
LONG
SAYING
KEEP
THE
PROJECT
THE
SAME
BUT
GIVE
ME
A
SHORTER
SCHEDULE
MAKES
ABOUT
AS
MUCH
SENSE
AS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
BASKETBALL
SMALLER
JUST
BY
SQUEEZING
IT
HARDER
AT
BEST
YOU
LL
TEMPORARILY
SQUEEZE
IT
INTO
A

AT

YOU
LL
DEFLATE
IT
MAKING
IT
UNUSABLE
FOR
ITS

WHEN

MORE
DEFECTS
ARE
CREATED
AND
FEWER
ARE
REMOVED
THE
PROJECT
TEAM
NOT
ONLY
HAS
TO
CORRECT
ALL
THE
MISTAKES
IT
MADE
IN
THE

BUT
IT
HAS
TO
CORRECT
THOSE
MISTAKES
AT
GREATER
COST
THAN
IF
THE

HAD
BEEN
DONE
CORRECTLY
IN

UNLIKE
SQUEEZING
A

SQUEEZING

IS
LIKELY
TO
MAKE
THE
OVERALL
PROJECT
LARGER
INSTEAD
OF
DEFLATING
IT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
ENSURE
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
PROJECT
EDUCATE
THE
OTHER
PROJECT
STAKEHOLDERS
ABOUT
THE
PRICE
OF
ARBITRARILY
CHANGING
COST
AND
SCHEDULE
ESTIMATES
WITHOUT
MAKING
CORRESPONDING
CHANGES
IN
THE
WORK
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
DONE
IF
YOU
RE
AN
UPPER

AND
YOU
WANT
THE

TEAM
TO
CUT
THE
SCHEDULE
IN

BE
AWARE
THAT
THE

ALWAYS
ASSUME
THE
THINGS
YOU
TAKE
FOR
GRANTED
WHEN
YOU
TELL
THEM
TO

THE

BE
SURE
TO

THAT
IT

THE

AT

WHEN

THE

IN
THAT

THIS

THE

THE

WITH

THE

AS

SO
IF
THE

AN

AND

BE
VIEWED
AS
A

APPROACH
TO

THE

IN

IT

UNLIKELY
THAT
THERE
ARE
OTHER

UNLESS

AN

THAT

THEREFORE
IT

WHETHER

THAT

BECAUSE

THIS
IS
THE

WE

THE

IN

IF

THE

BECOMES

THE
POSSIBLE
COMPLEXITY
OF

IS
A
WITNESS
TO
THE
STATIC
UNDECIDABILITY
OF
THIS
PROBLEM
THE
EVALUATION
OF
THE

MAY
MAKE
ARBITRARY
USE
OF

SO
THE
ENTIRE
SEMANTICS
IS
NEEDED
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
UNDEFINED
BASED
ON
THIS
NOTE
THAT
WHEN
TWO
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
UNSEQUENCED
IT
MEANS
THAT
EVALUATION
CAN
HAPPEN
IN
ANY
ORDER
THUS
IT
IS
NATURAL
TO
MAP
UNSEQUENCED
BEHAVIOR
INTO
NONDETERMINISTIC
BEHAVIOR
THIS
WAY
WE
CAN
USE
STATE
SPACE
EXPLORATION
AS
A
SINGLE
MECHANISM
TO
FIND
UNSEQUENCED
BEHAVIOR
TO
IDENTIFY
THIS
KIND
OF
UNDEFINED
BEHAVIOR
NAIVELY
CAN
BE
INCREDIBLY
COMPUTATIONALLY
EXPENSIVE
SOME
OPTIMIZATIONS
ARE
NECESSARY
TO
MAKE
THIS
FEASIBLE
WE
OFFER
TWO
SUCH
OPTIMIZATIONS
BELOW
FIRST
WITH
A
LITTLE
CASE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
DEFINITION
OF
THE
SEQUENCING
RELATION
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
SEQUENCED
WRITE
BEFORE
A
READ
OF
THE
SAME
OBJECT
WITH
NO
INTERVENING
SEQUENCE
POINT
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IF
IN
SEARCHING
THE
SEMANTIC
STATE
SPACE
WE
FIND
AN
EXECUTION
IN
WHICH
THE
WRITE
OF
A
SCALAR
OBJECT
HAPPENS
BEFORE
A
WRITE
OR
READ
OF
THE
SAME
OBJECT
WITH
NO
INTERVENING
SEQUENCE
POINT
THEN
WE
CAN
CONCLUDE
THAT
THIS
WRITE
WRITE
OR
WRITE
READ
PAIR
IS
UNSEQUENCED
WHENEVER
A
WRITE
IS
MADE
ITS
LOCATION
IS
RECORDED
IN
THE
LOCSWRITTENTO
CELL
WHICH
IS
EMPTIED
WHENEVER
A
SEQUENCE
POINT
IS
CROSSED
THIS
CELL
IS
FIRST
CHECKED
WHENEVER
A
READ
OR
WRITE
IS
MADE
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CONFLICT
THIS
STRATEGY
HAS
THE
ADDED
BENEFIT
THAT
SOME
UNDEFINED
BEHAVIORS
OF
THIS
KIND
CAN
BE
DETECTED
EVEN
DURING
INTERPRETATION
WHERE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
PATH
THROUGH
THE
STATE
SPACE
IS
EXPLORED
IT
IS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
STRATEGY
USED
BY
NORRISH
SECOND
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
A
LARGE
SUBSET
OF
ALLOWED
ORDERINGS
DO
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
IN
ORDER
TO
DETECT
UNDEFINED
BEHAVIOR
OR
POSSIBLE
NONDETERMINISTIC
BEHAVIORS
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
WRITES
BEFORE
OTHER
EVENTS
WE
CAN
TAKE
THE
LIBERTY
OF
APPLYING
SIDE
EFFECTS
IMMEDIATELY
INSTEAD
OF
DELAYING
THEM
WHAT
WOULD
IT
MEAN
FOR
THERE
TO
EXIST
AN
EXPRESSION
WHOSE
DEFINEDNESS
RELIED
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
A
SIDE
EFFECT
A
WRITE
OCCURS
LATER
INSTEAD
OF
EARLIER
THERE
MUST
BE
THREE
PARTS
TO
THE
EXPRESSION
A
SUBEXPRESSION
E
GENERATING
A
SIDE
EFFECT
X
AND
FOR
GENERALITY
SAKE
FURTHER
SUBEXPRESSIONS
E
AND
E
THE
PARTICULAR
EVALUATION
WHERE
WE
DO
SIDE
EFFECTS
IMMEDIATELY
WOULD
LOOK
LIKE
EXE
E
BECAUSE
THIS
IS
ALWAYS
A
POSSIBLE
EXECUTION
AND
WE
ASSUME
IT
DOES
NOT
SHOW
A
PROBLEM
WE
CAN
CONCLUDE
NEITHER
E
NOR
E
READS
OR
WRITES
TO
X
IF
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
ONLY
WHEN
WE
DELAY
THE
SIDE
EFFECT
IT
CAN
BE
SEEN
IN
A
PATH
LIKE
E
E
X
E
FOR
THIS
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
THAN
APPLYING
THE
CHANGES
TO
X
IMMEDIATELY
IT
MEANS
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
USE
OF
X
IN
THE
EVALUATION
OF
E
BUT
THIS
CONTRADICTS
THE
PREVIOUS
ASSUMPTION
THIS
SHRINKS
THE

DRAMATICALLY

AT
THE

EXPLORED

IN

DECIDED
TO

TO

THIS
IS
A

SENTIMENT
IN

INDEED
STARTLINGLY
FEW

THE
